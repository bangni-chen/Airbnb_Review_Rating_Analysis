"I’ve stayed in a hostel once before, and this one is nothing like what I imagined a hostel to be. The place is wonderfully cozy, warm, and has a homey feel. The location is excellent, the pods are comfortable, place is squeaky clean and the staff is amazing. On top of that, they even offer breakfast and really great coffee for guests. For the price and location, it’s unbeatable. I would definitely stay here again!",5
"The people in the photo (hosts) are not the people I ever saw at this location and don't seem to be on site. It was as described, and you should know that it is run by Hare Krishna. They are doing great work and offer simple meals at any time of the day to anyone staying. Everything was clean, and all of the hosts were friendly! I would stay here again!",5
"this is my fifth time visiting manhattan and this is my definitely amongst my favorites for accommodations i've stayed in. very cozy and clean, you'll feel right at home! they always have food and drink for guests, and the bathroom is even kept well stocked. it's nice and quiet as well, with quite a safe and comfortable feeling atmosphere. very kind and warm hosts that keep a lovely place, i'd definitely stay here again next time i'm here",5
"I love this place! As newbie coming into the city for work trips, this hostel is perfect for a couple days. The location is an easy walk from penn station, the staff is kind, and the place feels safe. Inside, it is clean, welcoming, and warm with snacks and coffee. The only issue I had were the late arrivals, 11 pm or 12 am, keeping me awake when I had to work in the morning. Otherwise, it's is great for a solo trip!",4
I have never stayed in a hostel before so I was a little nervous at first. This was a great experience. Photos are accurate. Everyone was respectful about quiet hours. The community area and kitchen was fantastic. The scones are amazing!! The staff is so helpful and friendly. I had no problems at all. I would definitely come back!,5
The host are very welcoming & explain everything to you about the place when you arrive. There’s always someone in the office 24/7 if you need to reach out. This is my go to whenever I’m in NYC. Beautiful Zen space for the solo traveler. I love the Chelsea neighborhood. The Italian restaurant & improv theater is right around the corner. Both are excellent! I highly recommend. 🙏,5
"The place was more expensive then what I would expect, but I enjoyed the location and hostel. the staff was really nice, the site was flexible in access, and the space was super clean and organized. I would definitely visit again based on it's proximity to work, the train, and my favorite places in Manhattan. Instructions were super understandable and the communication with the host was great!",5
"great place. exactly as described. friendly hosts and staff. the place is so clean, and the location is perfect. the 24hrs check-in option really worked for me! Read the description carefully, it is not a typical stay. (the fact that sound travels easily can interrupt your sleep if you are a light-sleeper.",5
"My husband stayed here for one night and then had to leave it was so bad. Hugely misrepresented in the airbnb photos and reviews. The cubicles were like cells. It was horribly loud, you could hear literally everything. He said he heard talking, snoring, and farting well into the night and even with earplugs he couldn't sleep. Bodily functions don't obey quiet hours. The hosts were kind and it was clean but this is bare bones. Is it really so expensive to put up some real walls? At least old school hostels used to have actual rooms.",2
"The staff is great, the room is clean, and the overall atmosphere is cozy. The team was very attentive and strongly emphasized the importance of keeping quiet. During the night, I understood why. Since the cubicles are not closed at the top, you can hear absolutely everything other guests do during the night. For me, this was unbearable, and I had to cancel my reservation the following day. I only recommend this place if you are a very heavy sleeper.",3
"4 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · 2 days ago This place was fantastic for the budget. I couldn’t ask for more. The daily free breakfast of bread, milk, and fresh fruits basically pays for itself to a certain extent. The room is small so it’s perfect for people that just need a place to sleep. But one thing to note is that you can’t bring any meat product in the building - which includes eggs and any canned food. It was a challenge for me to find affordable high quality protein for myself that needs to be eaten outside, so keep this in mind.",5
"Great stay, very affordable, clean showers and bathrooms. Nice breakfast area and fun cubicle like rooms with good wifi. Excellent location, staff is always available on demand 24/7 would book again a heartbeat.",5
The place is very clean and cozy. It is very helpful having someone 24/7 at the reception. It feels safe. There are a lot of breakfast options. Everyone is friendly. It is good value for the cost definitely.,4
"very good spot for a short stay in NY ! extremely well located, flexibility with check in, breakfast available, kind and responsive people. I can recommend it with my full heart !",5
"I had an amazing time at this place! The location is just great, and the amenities were surprisingly nice. Yana's scones are THE BEST thing ever, and she's a lovely person. Shout out to Jeremy, who was so nice as well. I look forward to staying here the next time I visit NYC.",5
This was my second time staying at Interfaith and I’ll definitely be back again! The location is absolutely incredible - 20 min walk to the Theatre District and Times Square. Staff are so pleasant and accommodating. Highly recommend.,5
"This place exceeded my expectation! It is a hostel style so all the cubicles are small and not closed all the way up (important!). However, due to well management, guests are fairly quite and considerate of others so my stay was easy and calm.",5
Wonderful place to be for a solo trip in the city of New York for the first time ever. I enjoyed how small and relaxed the place was. Was very clean and comfortable. I loved how close to everything the building was. Definitely hope to stay soon.,5
My only complaint is that the cubicle got kinda hot at night which made it difficult to sleep. I also encountered a guest who was trying to check in late at night and was not able to reach anyone on the phone. My check in went fine though. Overall I had a great stay,4
"clean, comfortable, convenient described very accurately read everything in the ad and in the messages and emails to know what to expect 24hour access to a variety of food was great friendly, helpful staff",5
"This place is exactly what is described. The location was great. It’s all I needed for my trip since I was only there for 24 hours. It’s walkable to everything, there are subway stations within 4 mins. I couldn’t have asked for a better spot.",5
This was a wonderful experience. I highly recommend staying here if you’re a solo traveler. The place is just as pictured and close to many of the main attractions. I wish I could’ve stayed longer.,5
"It is as described. Place to sleep and shower. If that’s what you’re looking for, it works well. Right by the ACE and 123 line, and Penn station. Instructions to check in and out were clear and easy.",5
Had a wonderful stay! Walkable distance to touristic places as well as the subway so transportation was easily accessible. I felt respected by the host and other guest. Communication was great and easy going! Will definitely stay again.,5
"As a first time solo traveler to NYC, this was the best place to stay I could have ever asked for. Loved how close it was to Penn Station, the ability to hold my luggage before and after check out, and how responsive the hosts were! Such a bang for your buck, I would recommend it to anyone!",5
"Amazing prime location, and very good price for that location. But some conditions like no non vegetarian foods allowed and lack of roof(everything is audible to everyone in that floor); these conditions are little harsh. But they were mentioned clearly while booking the room, so read throughly. Definitely need to vacate, if we violate the conditions. Other than food and sound privacy, host is amazing and friendly, very responsive and respectful. Nice location and price. Check conditions and book.",3
"This was my second time at this location. I had stayed at the New York Spirit Retreat (same location 4th floor) earlier and was pleasantly surprised to see the difference in comfort at Interfaith- the bathrooms are much more spacious and the space overall is much more comfortable. Love the common area on the 3rd floor. As a vegetarian myself, I loved that no meat, eggs and fish are allowed. The staff is responsive and amiable. I loved reading, praying and connecting with more folks at the building. The muffins were my favorite.",5
This is my second time at this hostel and once again everything was great. They really take care of you and make sure everything is squeaky clean! Staff are all helpful and kitchen options are awesome. Thanks again guys!,5
"Booked for 4 day 3 nights, but couldn't stay there after the first night and checked myself into a hotel. Everyone around you is snoring; and they employ a Chinese lady at night to keep watch and wake up snorers - but you can't sleep either way. 25 cubicles with beds 3/4 size of a single bed, and only 3 bathrooms and showers, walking around in circles to get there. If you're on a tight budget this might be for you, but if you have some standards book yourself a hotel.",1
"Lovely, accommodating, and communicative hosts. This Airbnb is situated unbelievable close to the “heart” of NYC. I couldn’t have chosen a better place to stay and I’ll definitely be back.",5
This is my go to place whenever I’m in the city. Very convenient Penn Station and the word authority. I always feel at home there very Zen and peaceful. Highly recommend.,5
"Excellent location—everything was within easy walking distance, which made the stay especially convenient. A thoughtful touch: complimentary earplugs were provided, which proved helpful at night given the close proximity to neighboring guests.",4
It’s my go to place when I’m in the city. Chelsea is very convenient to Penn Station & Port Authority. Friendly and helpful staff! Zen & peaceful. I highly recommend for the solo traveler. 😊☮️,5
"A wonderful place with a very pleasant atmosphere. You can really feel the care for guests: cleanliness, order, and comfort are at a high level. The staff is friendly and helpful. A great option both for a short stay and for long-term accommodation. Thank you for the hospitality!",5
"It was an amazing stay, had the best time. Definitely recommend this place to others, and for myself too, for the next time! Absolutely clean, hyegenic, and a good vibes stay! Loved it, had so much peace. Thank you !",5
"I’m really glad I stayed here. The room was always kept extremely clean, and the location was very convenient for getting anywhere. It felt like it gave me more time to truly enjoy my trip. I would definitely love to stay here again!",5
"It has been a nice experience staying in new york city which was my ""home"" in a short period, and this stay was very friendly and the cost is unprecedentedly nice and the home made cookies are nice.",5
"Just what I was looking for everything is super nice, I arrived in the morning and they offered me breakfast, it was incredible, and the day of my departure they kept my things to continue enjoying NY, super recommended... just don't make noise that if it's very serious.",5
"This is a good option if you are in need of a place for the night. You get what you see in the photo - for walls and a mattress. My stay was decent, everyone seemed to understand the rules and were respectful of each other.",5
My first time visiting in new york city and so glad I booked this bnb ❤️ I got well rested and people at the front desk are nice too! Great people and great team! I will definitely come back here when I visit new york again 🥰,5
"If you need a simple bed and private “room” for a very good price in the nearby of NYC, this is it. Perfect for solo travelers and if you want a budget bed to crash on. Showers, toast/bagel breakfast, and the private, locking door space are great for the prime location next to MSG and Penn Station",5
"Perfect location, very clean. Easy check in and out - thank you for making everything so convenient!",5
"PROS: Location is top notch. The staff is VERY friendly. Shared bathrooms/showers very clean. Water machine broke one day and was immediately worked on and fixed. The staff is great. Love that they offer drinks and small snacks at all hours. Staff member there at all times. CONS: It is small- so do you research and check measurements- I'm 5'9 and the bed was too small for me. I hit my head twice in the bathroom- but again they do list measurements in listing so just make sure room would work for you. My biggest complaint is the noise. They do their best- but there are snorers. You will hear MULTIPLE alarms going off all before 7am (some being hit on snooze or just left on for minutes at a time) and even though they have ""quiet hours"" there will phone calls/facetimes all around you. The best sleep I got was midday- but my sleep was severely affected unfortunately by other tenants. So it's the roll of the dice and hope you get decent people with manners. Besides the noise- great stay.",3
"Great solution if you want to stay for a few nights in Manhattan on a budget! Perfect location, quite clean, friendly staff available 24/7, breakfast included. The ceiling of the cubicle is open, so you'll get the snores (and smell) of your neighbors, but it's clearly communicated in advance. I stayed 6 nights; during two nights the staff woke up others to stop them from snoring, and one night the police even came because someone didn't collaborate. The staff handled everything very well though and I never felt unsafe, but even with earplugs I found it sometimes difficult to sleep. Lastly, Im 6'3"" (190 cm), and didn't fit flat on the bed as it was a bit short. Luckily I'm a side sleeper! Would definitely recommend and come back as well! Thanks a lot!",5
Lovely hostel. Rooms are small but if silo traveling it’s perfect. It’s also in Manhattan so it makes traveling easy. 10/10 I’d stay again! Friendly staff.,5
"This place is budget-friendly, and has a walkable distance to great restaurants and metro stations. The hosts are easy to communicate with; the staffs are professional and available 24/7; the restroom is surprisingly clean with spotless toilets. As mentioned in the description, the rooms are not soundproof. I appreciate the hosts for being upfront on this issue, and for their efforts in maintaining the quietness, such as having the quiet hour from 8pm-8am, and providing the earplugs. However, there are about 10--20 guests, so it is hard to make sure that everyone stays quiet throughout the night. I am kind of a light sleeper, but I am on budget, so I tried this place; I turn out to be ok with staying for one night, but two nights or anytime longer starts to be difficult for me.",5
Great place to stay if you are in the city by yourself. The hosts are very friendly and considerate with privacy and respect,5
"I loved the cubicle, it gave me everything I needed with was a place to sleep and enjoy the areas of the city.",5
"My second stay and it was just as great as the first time. Excellent location, quiet accommodations, all for a great price.",5
"The place was cozy and nice, perfect for single travelers who need a cheap stay in central NY",5
"A truly meaningful stay. Volunteering was a wonderful experience, and the hosts were incredibly kind. Great location.",5
"Definitely recommend to people who are solo travelers. I always wanted to go to NYC alone but did not want to pay 200$ by myself for a hotel room. Also I love watching musicals, going to jazz bars so saving money by staying in New jersey was a bit tricky. I would say this is the best place if u are wanting to enjoy the night of NYC + want to stay close to the penn station. It is 5 min walk from Penn station and the broadway is 7-10 min walk. The famous Jazz bars which I love to go, birdland is also 7 min walk. Absolutely loved it. About the bathroom, I kinda have anxiety of sharing bathrooms but to my surprise it was always clean. Loved it. The only thing I will say is about the bed size. It was fine with me to sleep on but I do not think you will have a good sleep if you are a big person, tall or big :) Anyways the staff members are also nice and u can drop your bags in the place which is really helpful if u r planning to immediately start hanging around in NYC.",5
"A great stay for the price in Chelsea. It’s communal living and everything is spotless, and the staff is very friendly and helpful. Definitely a go-to stay when in NYC.",5
"Terrific location, well-run hostel, friendly and helpful staff. Will absolutely stay there again.",5
"I had a great time at this hotel! My room had an amazing view, the location was right where I wanted to be, in Times Square, near different theaters. The check in and check out were very easy. All in all, I would stay in this hotel again and make sure to stay in it if i wanted to stay near Times Square again.",5
"I had a great experience staying at the Hilton in New York City, from the moment I checked in, to the moment I checked out. Michelle at the front desk, was very helpful and even checked us in early. I’ve stayed in New York multiple times and this was by far the best place I’ve ever stayed at and also the cleanest. It’s in the great location and I would definitely stay here again!",5
Great location for getting around. Near to all underground stations. Good heating in the room. Room was quite small and nowhere to put heavy clothes. Kept it all in the cases! Comfy bed. Coffee maker and microwave.,5
We completely enjoyed our stay. It is central to everything which made commuting and seeing sights easy. Host was great and answered my questions beforehand. I would definitely come back!,5
"I absolutely loved my stay here. I would highly recommend it if you’re coming to NYC for the first time. Everything is walkable, Times Square is right there, and subways are nearby. Staff was incredibly kind, and Jason was a very friendly and responsive host.",5
E3ally liked the experience apart from the $30/night charge that was added to 2hat I paid through Airbnb. Supposedly for wifi and dry cleaning whether you need it or not. Other coupons were included but this significant additional expense per night came as a surprise at check in.,5
"Great location. Walkable from time square and right in front of the hop on hop off stop which was extremely convenient. Room was super small and barely had space to walk around, but in all a good place.",4
"perfect location to visit downtown NY. Time square is right after the corner, central Park 25minutes by walk. everything was as desired. The lady with glasses at the front desk was so kind and helpful. Kudos to her!",5
"The location was close to everything—literally steps from Bryant Park and right in the heart of Times Square. It made getting around NYC incredibly easy, whether we were sightseeing, shopping, or grabbing food. The staff was extremely helpful, friendly, and accommodating from check-in to check-out. The room was clean and comfortable, and despite being in such a busy area, it was surprisingly quiet at night. I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend it for anyone visiting New York City.",5
Hosts were responsive to original reservation and everything was exactly as they said it would be. Location could not be beat!!! restaurant on premises and very friendly front desk staff!!! We will definitely be back!!!!,5
I had a decent stay at this hotel and my host was very responsive.. place was very clean and nice.. I’ll surely book again sometime in the future and all recommend it to friends..,4
"Great facilities and an awesome location! It's a block away from Times Square and Bryant Park. We took the Hop-on Hop-off bus right outside the hotel and the Newark Express to Newark Airport in front of Bryant Park. You can walk to most NYC attractions from there. In the lobby is Paul's on Times Square restaurant, which has great food and service. We went to NYC for my father's birthday, and he was amazed by the hotel.",5
"My stay at the hotel was great. It is located just steps away from the most popular clothing stores, such as Zara and H&M, very close to Bryant Park, and only a short walk from Times Square. Truly a perfect location to visit the city’s iconic spots without the need to take a taxi or public transportation. The room met my expectations, and the service I received at the front desk was appropriate.",5
"If you’re looking for basic room and amenities in the center of NYC’s Times Square, Hilton Garden Inn is a great place to stay. The price is right and it’s a walking distance from a lot of touristic attractions. I prefer a quieter location with more amenities for an extra price per night. But this was perfect because it was a walking distance from my conference.",4
"My stay in NY was amazing, big part thanks to hotel staff! They were all very supportive, helpful, kind and so good in what they are doing that i was amazed! thanks to all!",5
The Hilton Garden Inn was a wonderful hotel and I would definitely stay there again. The staff was amazing and our Airbnb host. Jason was extremely accommodating and very helpful with any questions we had.,5
The hotel itself was clean and comfortable. The cleaning staff was super attentive and made sure we had what we needed. Check in was simple and the free coffee was so good. Everything was walking distance and near transportation. I would definitely rebook with them.,5
"The hotel was in the best location, close to the subway, walking distance to the middle of Times Square and the best food places all within walking distance. Hotel staff were so great! I would definitely stay here again! Jason was very responsive to any messages and very helpful!",5
The hotel lobby and room were well maintained and the staff was friendly and helpful. My room on the 27th floor was surprisingly quiet given the location and the bed was comfortable. The hotel is in a great location and was really close to Bryant Street Park and the subway system.,5
"Amazing location! Perfect for getting around the city. Rooms are small but that’s NYC, and everything was extremely clean. Will definitely consider staying again next time!",5
"We had a wonderful stay at Hilton Garden Suites Times Square Central! The staff was friendly, welcoming, and always helpful, which made our trip even more enjoyable. The location is perfect—right in the heart of Times Square, making it easy to walk to Broadway shows, great restaurants, and subway stations. The room was clean, comfortable, and had everything we needed for a convenient stay in New York City. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a central spot with excellent service!",5
Great place to stay! Staff was very friendly and gave great recommendations. Lovely restaurant in the lobby and beautiful room + view.,5
"Great location right in Times Square! Easy check in, beautiful views, & fantastic service! Thank you will come again.",5
I had a great stay. Beautiful views very clean and very clear instructions for check in and check out. I will be booking again in the future !,5
"Everything was as advertised and the location was extremely convenient for all the Christmas markets, Broadway shows, and New York landmarks.",5
"Hotel was in a great location, literally steps away from Times Square and close to the subway! My husband and I had a great time and we will be back!!",5
Amazing location. The check in process was very smooth even with a very long queue. The staff were very helpful with all my queries.,5
"Great stay! The shower was incredible! Quiet, Friendly, efficient, held our bags for no charge. Perfect everything.",5
"Centric place to stay at, close to the metro which made it so much easier to move around . I would stay here again 100%",5
"On a solo weekend trip (and as a former New Yorker who knows NYC fairly well), I chose this hotel for its central location and walkability, cleanliness, safety, and a good night's sleep. It's in an excellent location right by the Times Square train station with access to a million lines to take you anywhere, a quick walk to/from Penn Station train station (as I'd be taking the NJ Transit from Newark airport), and a quick walk to Broadway shows and many key NYC sites like Empire, Rockefeller, Bryant Park, etc. As it's in a central busy location with Times Square's constant bright lights, I always felt safe walking back by myself even at 2am. There is always a security guard at the front door too. This is a no frills not super fancy place, but is excellent for a reliable clean room, unbeatable location, safe area for solo traveler, and quiet sleep. Lobby staff were great and friendly. You're paying for location here to maximize time spent out in NYC, not a luxurious hotel stay.",4
We enjoyed our stay! This was a great hotel room. The room was small but not abnormal for hotels in the area. This was a good home away from home. I would stay here again.,5
"The host is not actually the hotel itself, but an intermediary on Airbnb. When we arrived at the hotel, the hotel had not received the reservation details, and together with the hotel manager Joe. we had to reach out to the host to obtain the required information. The whole process lasted about an hour or so. Joe the hotel manager was very helpful and understanding, and treated us very well while we had to wait to sort this out. Other than that, all was great, the location especially is hard to beat. The price was much higher than normal though, due to the dates (during UNGA80). All in all, a great place to stay, and we would stay again.",4
"To be at walking distance from the majority of the places I visited in NYC, plus being able to have a well rested sleep at the Hilton Times Square, was an awesome mini-vacay I’d to all over again and again.",5
"I had an amazing stay at the Hilton Garden Inn in NYC! The location was perfect — close to major attractions, subway stations, and plenty of restaurants. The room was spotless, comfortable, and quiet, which made it easy to relax after a long day exploring the city. The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful, always greeting me with a smile and quick to answer questions or offer recommendations. The amenities, including the mini-fridge, coffee maker, and comfortable bed, made the stay even better. Everything about my experience was smooth and pleasant — from check-in to check-out. I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend it to anyone visiting New York City!",5
"Good location for a few days in NYC. Walkable, close to the subway, doors lock at 11 ensuring guest safety (can use room card to get in), complementary coffee and tea in the mornings, gym, laundry, $10 credit for snacks. Downsides include previous guests belongings left in room including dirty socks and a bag of medication and fridge did not work. Overall, not a bad place to stay to visit and explore.",4
My mom and I came to NYC for some Broadway shows! The location was perfect for that. We loved being able to walk to everything. We were able to drop our bags off before check in. The staff was friendly and accommodating. The host was helpful and responsive. We would definitely stay again next time we come to NYC.,5
Great location and the staff was very friendly and helpful. They were very patient with explaining the fees that you are paying such as destination fees and making sure that we were all good to go when checking in. I really appreciate the staff holding our bags before and after check-in. It really made our trip so much more comfortable and easier. Thank you again and we hope to stay here again.,4
"HGI has an amazing walkable location. Blocks away from Times Square, Joe’s Pizza, and plenty of subway entrances. We had an amazing time and will most definitely be back again! We had great service at the hotel and the ability to check our bags the last day while we explored before our flight was so convenient. There is so much to do near this hotel. We will be back again for sure",5
"The location is great. Just beside Times Square metro station, and a few blocks from the best Broadway theaters. The hospitality services are very good, and they have some complimentary goods for the guests that make the stay even more comfortable. The room services are made every day, keeping the room always clean and well organized. A very good choice for a fair cost-benefit stay at the Times Square area.",5
"The Hilton garden Inn was incredible, it is really near to Times Square, and others importants attractions on NYC such as Rockefeller center and public library, the room is a little be small but it is perfect to rest after a long day, it's very quiet and comfortably. The hotel has in the lobby an store that is good for a little snack of beverage.",5
"This hotel is centrally located at Times Square, it had all the amenities I wanted like a fridge and microwave, was very clean and the staff were super friendly. I will definitely stay here again!! The price was good as well -- my brother stayed in Harlem at a hotel that was 2x the price and didn't even have a fridge!",5
"We planned a trip to NYC to go to Broadway and see some shows. This Hilton is perfectly situated and close to everything. It was under renovation, but our room was fine. The bed was comfy, there was hot water and plenty of towels. Aside from that we were out the door every day. One nice thing they did was hold our luggage after the last play we saw, before we headed out of town. Really appreciated that!",5
Great stay if you want to be in the middle of the city. Times Square was literally just steps away. Staff was very friendly and accommodating.,5
"Fabulous room, close to everything and the staff was highly attentive",5
Excellent. Clean. Well located. Helpful staff. Fairly priced.,5
"Great stay! Close to everything, check in and checkout was easy, we enjoyed our time!",5

"Location is amazing, walking distance to multiple subway lines. Check in was very smooth and the hotel is able to hold luggage before check in/after check out.",5
"Very worn down. Unwelcoming reception, old and does not match pictures Not worth the money paid",1
Really great place to stay. Right in the city and the employees are all very friendly. I felt very safe staying there alone! Will keep this in mind if I go back!!,5
Absolutely loved the location. Was dead center to everything. Subway was only a 2 minute walk. Definitely recommend this hotel.,5

Excellent location! absolutely enjoyed my stay. The staff was very friendly and the rooms were comfortable.,5
"Everything was nice here, comfortable bed, issue with water coming out into bathroom when showering, however once reported it was fixed.",5
"We loved this hotel!!! It was so clean and in a perfect spot, right by Tmes Square. The price was great, the room was super nice with a standup shower. We didn't experience any ""city noise"" and the staff was a delight. We will definitely be booking again when we stay in the city!",5
Hilton Garden Inn Times Square Central 42nd street is at a very convenient location to reach what NY Times Square has to offer. The staff members were very attentive and helpful. We are very happy for our stay at this location and recommend this place as a top of the list lodging alternative.,5
The host along with all of the staff were amazing. The location was ideal and close to everything. The room was super clean and the hotel staff were attentive. I slept well in the bed and the smart tv was appreciated.,5
"Super convenient spot in time square. Rooms with all necessary electronics appliances such as microwave, coffee maker, and frig. People are so very friendly and responsive! Super good daily credit for water and laundry. Free Starbucks everyday is awesome!",5
"Clean, well kept. Friendly!!!! Amazing location.",5
This is a great place to stay and it’s right next to the Square.,5
Great location! Would book this place again!,5
Excellent location! Will be staying here again!,5
Awesome place to stay. Everything in the description is correct. Thanks,5
"Great location, friendly staff. Will book again for my next NY trip.",5
"All Good, but it’s been 15 days al ready and i haven’t got my deposit back. Can some one help me?",1
"It came as a surprise that my room was not made after the first day. Upon asking, I was informed it was every second day. I was also charged an additional $94.76 which was not specified when I booked. Including ""destination charge"" (what was that for??) and four different line items of City Tax. The Destination Charge is a hidden fee relating to ""non-optional"" services provided at the property. It was non-avoidable, and a should have been part of the booking rate. Very sneaky and unethical of Hilton to operate this way.",4
Excellent place to stay due to its location,5
Perfect location! Close to everything! Enjoyed our stay!,5
Great stay just steps away from Times Square!,5
Good place to stay and in a good location near Times Square,4
staff and location were perfect,5
Great place to stay highly recommend,5
"Great location, close to everything.",5
"We went to work in the city and rented it for our team. Excellent location, great amenities, very good bed. The hotel allows you to leave your luggage in the lobby, which was very important for our departure and arrival. Cleaning is available every day and free Starbucks coffee in the lobby daily. We highly recommend this place! Translated from Portuguese Show original",5
Great stay - highly recommend & will return again in the future.,5
Great location to Times Square. Clean. Beautiful hotel.,5
"Good location, decent size and cleanliness.",4

"7 years on Airbnb Rating, 1 star , · May 2025 I have given this hotel one star because of being charged twice for taxes. The hotel itself was good, great area, quite for location, clean bathroom so no complaints there. Negatives were common areas etc need refurbishment but this is of reflected in the price paid. Only 3 elevators for 36 floors and one was out for the whole 8 nights of our stay. Wait times were ok but can be extended in busy periods. Staff were friendly and room serviced daily by a lovely lady. My issue is all taxes and charges were paid to Airbnb except for the destination charge which was to be paid to the hotel. As checkout was busy express checkout was suggested with the invoice emailed. Upon receipt I had been charged the destination charge plus local taxes that had already been paid. No amount of phone calls to the hotel or Airbnb has reversed this mistake of US$308. Clearly both companies have no idea what their process is. Other reviews seems to replicate my experience. Don’t book on Airbnb is my advice.",1
Great location. Close to time square & Bryant Park. Easy walk from the subway. Everyone was nice and helpful. loved it!,5
"We had security trying to get into our room aggressively one morning. They knocked multiple times, we told them ""not right now"" and they said they will come back later. We were still trying to sleep. They came back again and actually opened our door, we had a do not disturb sign on and we were in bed. They apologized and left. They came back again later, until I spoke to the front desk. We were woken up every morning of our stay at about 9am to an announcement from the front desk repeating something like ""Attention, we will be conducting a test on the fire alarm system. If you see flashes or strobes, ignore them and stay in your room."" This repeated about 3x per announcement. It was very annoying, as we were here for a birthday trip and were out late at night but we would get woken up daily to this. The fridge in the room had trash left in it from the previous person staying in it. Overall, not very happy with the stay and wouldn't recommend.",1
"10 months on Airbnb Rating, 3 stars , · April 2025 Staff is quite shitty and there are door noises, room isn’t cleaned on time. Location is fabulous tho",3
"This would have been a 5 star review if I wasn’t dealing with payment issues regarding improper charges two weeks after checking out. The hotel was perfectly located and very convenient. The room was very comfortable and had everything we needed. The bathroom looked recently renovated and everything was cleaned daily. They stored our luggage after check out, which was really helpful. Staff was friendly but did not help us after we were handed a report including excessive charges billed to my credit card that were not described here in this listing. I was expecting to pay the destination fee of $34.42 + $3.50 per night + refundable damage deposit, but instead we were charged double that price in unreasonable taxes and fees. I was told by the staff in the front desk that I should sort it out with the hosts from Airbnb, which I have been doing since we checked out but no resolution was offered so far. This was very disappointing and I wouldn’t trust this hotel again unfortunately.",4
"This was the perfect location to be right in the middle of everything! Restaurants, Shops, Subways. etc.",5
"upon my arrival there was a young lady was helpful n kind she took my suitcase cause I was a little early for check in. when I arrived back to the hotel, this guy assisted with payment etc I was with my neice as stands an observed, he took my credit card swiped said every was fine, however I left without my suitcase because everyone else was getting there's bought to them etc n bout up to the room so I'm thinking they bought my bags to the room which was on the 21 st fl , mind u this is my bday wkend my I met my neice for the first time!! we continued our way to the room.. Boom no suitcase all the back down stairs, and my neice waiting.. later that night, we had dinner reservations came back showered of course now I turn on the shower ran gathered my evening wear went back to the bathroom shower is cold now this is about 10 mins on my behalf, I called downstairs told them and this heifa is going go tell me turn the sink ok hot and the shower then run it for 10 mins... to be continu",1

"8 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · 1 week ago Great place. Comfortable",5
Great place and location!,5
Great stay,5
Perfect,5
"Very good location. I was a little afraid of the noise but even being on the inner floors, the room was very quiet. The location is ideal for visiting the city on foot or very well served by the metro. Perfect room for one person, maybe a little small for two people with two suitcases. Translated from French Show original",5
"Excellent location, really nice comfortable rooms.",5
Awesome location and great hotel!,5
Very convenient. Close to restaurants and theaters.,5
Hilton quality in a great location.,5
It was really good to stay here.Thank you very much,5
The housekeeping every day was nice.,5
"NYC is pricey, but all things considered the staff were helpful and friendly. They even provided a snack credit from their snack/amenities shop.",5
We will absolutely be staying here again. It was so central to everything.,5
Extra fees that host will not mention. Recommend booking through the hotel and not Airbnb.,1
Host was amazing. He was incredibly helpful and kind. Would book with him again no doubt!,5
"Excellent apartment, bed, bedding, shower, water and ice machines on some floors also helped a lot. Great communication with hotel staff and around here. Great location and great value. Translated from Portuguese Show original",5
Very nice location and hotel!,4
Great hotel,5
Great location!!,5
Clean peaceful nice staff,5
Everything perfect,5
"Very central location, a stone's throw from Times Square. Small room as expected in NYC but comfortable and functional. Water and coffee available at the reception. Average value for money in the area. Recommended!! Translated from Italian Show original",5
"Totally recommended for the location (on 42 St ideal). We arrived early and there was no problem. As well as the kindness and good service of all the staff, from the reception to the cleaning. Translated from Spanish Show original",5
"Clean, cozy, and quiet… front desk staff we're all superb",5
Great location! Friendly host! I do recommend!,5
Situated at Times Square location and near to subway stations for access. Easy to navigate subway. Take advantage of getting a “senior” metro card. Subway much better to get around in Manhattan. Site location is excellent. Room was as shown in photo. Neat and clean but on the smaller side. Guard at front entrance makes for a good secure and safe entry. Reception area at an upper level. Reception staff pleasant and helpful.,4
"We’re very happy with our stay and would definitely come back! This is not our first visit NYC and we’ve stayed at many different hotels around the city. This hotel has a prime location, friendly staff, thorough cleaning, lots of dining options in the area etc. Only downside is the waiting time for the elevators during rush hour (in the morning for instance).",5
"Finding the hotel was easy and it’s conveniently next to the Times Square-42nd St subway entrance. The room was a bit smaller than it looks in the picture but the place was clean and comfortable. Location wise it is close to a lot of restaurants and stores. Bryant Park is a five minute walk away and a great place to enjoy a cup of coffee or a bagel. Overall, I had a great time!",5
"Me and my Girlfriends stay here was a time to remember! Although there are fees that I wish I knew about before I booked, the overall stay was magical. This location is right in the heart of time square and it was very easy to navigate and get around the city of New York with the subway station not even a 45 second walk away from the entrance! I highly recommend without a doubt!",5
"Hotel is a perfect to stay if you plan to travel to New York. Just a few meters to Times Square, Grand Central, etc. Also sorrounded with subway stations where you could get to other parts of New York. Only issue is posting says destination charge doesn’t says per night but during check out it was charge per night. But overall stay was one to remember for us. Definitely would come back to stay in this Hotel.",5
"The hotel is good and close to times square. The staff is friendly and treat you well. It had smaller room that what was expected. No one serves you water for drinking, or making coffee in room. You need to get into the long line at the reception and get a small bottle of water which doesn't help for anything. Would recommend to plan some better arrangements for providing water to guests for coffee in odd hours.",3
"Right form the beginning this was the BEST stay we've EVER had in NYC. The hotel was spotless, the staff were the FRIENDLIEST people, the restaurants was amazing, the location was fantastic, and the fact that they have a parking garage at their disposal.....chef's kiss!! We cant wait to come back here and are already planning our next trip. Definitely the only place we will stay from now on....",5
"The hotel is perfectly located on Times Square! The staff is very friendly and welcoming! Moreover, these points made us forget the price of additional taxes not mentioned by airbnb Be careful because the hotel takes occupancy taxes indicated on the description but airbnb also charges the same taxes… which is not too normal because not indicated on the description… so thank you airbnb 😔 Translated from French Show original",5
Great spot if you want to be in the middle of everything,5
"Stay was great, right in Times Square and check in was easy",5
"Staff was always very friendly. Broken shades, not a big deal since our view was an alley and other buildings. Liked having fridge and microwave in room. Shower tile floor had rust stains but water was hot anf good pressure. Plenty of outlets. Overall good value",4
My stay here was great ! The room was very spacious and clean the bathroom was great ! Right in times squares was near everywhere I needed to go for my trip would recommend anytime will be booking again,5
"This location is ideal for anyone coming to town on business or pleasure. One block from Bryant Park and Times Square. Comfy bed, super fast wifi! Amazing and kind staff all around from the front desk to the bar! I will definitely be back!",5
"The front desk staff were amazing. Welcoming, friendly and accommodating. The room was very small but it was ok for me since I was solo but I am not sure it would work for more than 2 people. While the room was clean there was a very strong smell of bleach upon arrival and there were areas of the room that showed the age of the hotel. Overall it was a decent place the stay right in heart of Times Square. Surprisingly my room was very quiet and I was able to get a good nights sleep.",5
Excellent experience!!! Clean spacious friendly staof with great customer service awesome prices perfectly located in the heart of Time Square and yet quiet and peaceful. Amazing and thoughtful host. I will book again.,5
"The Hilton Garden Inn Times Square, Central was a wonderful experience. The location, our room, and our host were exceptional. We will definitely stay again when we return to New York!",5
"Hilton Garden Inn Times Square Central NYC was a perfect find for our visit to the city. Its prime location was within walking distance of numerous attractions, restaurants, and, of course, the vibrant Times Square. The hotel is also well-connected to multiple subway lines, which made it easy for us to explore further. The staff is friendly and helpful, adding to a welcoming atmosphere. Highly recommended for a convenient, short and enjoyable stay!",5
1 block from Times Square John's Pizza 🍕 right there! We were able to walk to the Statue of Liberty one day and then Central Park the next.... walked to the WTC memorial on the final morning perfect 1st time In NYC experience 😊,5
"if you're there to site see, perfect location. Although, since it's a busy location, it's hard to get an uber there. but the rooms are very nice, course to two major subway stations.",5
"My daughter and I loved the location! The people at the hotel were also very helpful. It was wonderful having a refrigerator and microwave in the room. Two blocks away is an amazing bakery called Paris baguette that we ate at each morning. Bryant Park is also located a couple blocks away, it was lovely and a great location to eat lunch. Jason was very responsible when we had questions. If I return to New York I would happily stay there again!",5
"Excellent location. The place was very nice and clean. Only thing is the bathroom door didnt lock and in a small room that could be a hassle but for us it all worked out just great. Would stay again for shure!! Outstanding communication and service from Jason , (host here on air b&b. ) Great job.",5
Very enjoyable stay. Perfect location close to the subway. Quiet and clean. Just beware that taxes are not included and that if you want to do an early check in it’s $75 extra.,5
"Overall, it was a great place to stay for 3 nights! a convenient location with plenty to do as you're squat in the middle of central. my only qualm is that transport to and from JFK airport is worth checking price wise.",4
This room was great as I was really only in to sleep! Bed was super comfy and I enjoyed the option of turning on the big screen if I wanted to catch up on a show before bed :) will def stay here again as I loved the location!,5
"Everything matched description. Place was very clean and location was just perfect for that price! Walkable to Times Square and Rockfeller center. A huge variety of restaurants nearby and markets. A small kitchen but it has everything you need. If we go to NYC again, I definitely stay here.",5
"If you just need a place to sleep, simple bathroom, and a great location, this place is perfect. If you’re looking for privacy and lots of amenities, this isn’t the best option. We had everything we needed and were thrilled with the location. The apartment is quiet and humble, quite tiny, but accurately presented in the listing.",5
"The place was pretty much as expected; i was solo traveler for one night and was not sure how i would feel, but it felt secure once i got thru the initial process. It is tight quarters but I knew that and did not need a ton of space. The location was great and helped me have a quick visit. The smart tv had more options than i expected and provided some comfort when in the room. I was pleasantly surprised that in the shared space there was a fridge, stove burners, electric kettle, some plates, cups, utensils. And it was reasonably quiet for mid town. Thanks for providing an alternative to an expensive hotel further away.",5
Adam the host was helpful and very informative and responded on time. My stay was comfortable clean and quiet. I would definitely recommend anyone coming to NewYork and need a place close to Time square and food to look up 787 9th st!,5
I enjoyed my time there and felt safe as a solo traveller. No problems with shared bathroom. Cleaner was lovely and welcoming. A great base and I would recommend. Thank you Adam,5
This place was exactly as listed. It was in the heart of Hells Kitchen so very close to a lot of restaurants and bars including a ton of the queer/gay bars. The room is very small but if you are only really planning to be in the room to just mostly sleep it’s a great place to stay. Would definitely stay again and recommend.,5
"For that location and price tag, the bedroom matched my expectation, but the bathroom was very clean and comfortable and exceeded my expectation. Check-in instructions were also very clear. My only complaint is that the hangers weren't clean enough, so we had to hang our clothes on the chair instead of in the wardrobe. But overall, comfortable and clean experience, and reasonable price tag.",4
"Great, centrally located apartment. Clean, safe, comfortable bed and friendly host. Good price and great value. Will book again.",5
This room was great. Adam was super responsive and helpful. The area is full of really good restaurants. I had a great time!,5
Perfect location with walkable distance to times square and other Manhattan areas. The room is tiny but neat and tidy. Other areas of the bathroom and kitchen are shared but organized and clean.,4
"Easy check-in, Adam was a responsive host, not noisy during sleep time (which is rare in NYC), awesome location in the heart of Hell’s Kitchen, and VERY good value! Will look to stay here again next time I’m in town. Would recommend!",5
"Great stay! the unit was clean and everything was as described. Very small but its NYC and it was perfect for one person. Great location in a fun area and only a few blocks from the train. Overall, great stay.",5
Adam’s place is perfect for anyone who needs somewhere to sleep comfortably and safely in New York. It’s easily accessible to a lot of things. Everything was clean. The check-in was easy. Everything is very well automized.,5
I enjoyed the perfect accommodations for my short trip! Thank you for your hospitality!,5
"A bed for the night in Hells Kitchen, clean, good linens, comfortable rest.",5
"I had a wonderful stay at this Airbnb in Hell’s Kitchen! The location was perfect—just a short walk to Times Square, great restaurants, and convenient public transport. The host was kind, responsive, and made check-in smooth and easy. The space itself was cozy, clean, and well-equipped, offering a relaxing retreat after long days exploring the city. I especially appreciated the thoughtful touches like extra towels and variety of coffee capsules for enjoyment. Despite being in the heart of Manhattan, the place was surprisingly quiet at night. Overall, it was a lovely experience and I’d definitely stay here again. Highly recommended!",5
"Great location and smooth check-in. The room was clean and perfect for a short stay, although it was a bit small.",5
The location was close to everything. The room was clean and felt safe. I would stay there again.,5
"Very easy to get in, the instructions with photos and automated door unlocking worked very well (tip: another guest logged first to wifi for the last door, to his room). Note that the address is the one in the instructions. Not sure why the one Airbnb lists is different. There is one bathroom for 3 rooms so be sure to get your shower early if you are in a rush and be mindful of others possibly waiting. The little kitchenette was great to toast my bread and make my tea. The room was very small but very clean, the bed was comfortable. The only issue was the heat was very hot, coming up behind the bed. When I called for help it was suggested to either turn on the AC or open the window (or both). I'm a light sleeper and the AC kept walking me up on each new cycle. So I just opened wider the widow but kept being either hot or cold. If you sleep soundly this may not be an issue and the comforter may work well for you in a cool room.",3
"Place is clean, check in instructions are really good and good location too.",4
It's my first trip to NY and I highly recommend it! Super well located and excellent communication with Adam! I'll definitely stay here on my next visit to NY! don't hesitate and stay 😎 Translated from Spanish Show original,5
Everything went smooth. Adam was very efective.,4
"The place is ok, considering that is in the basement. The location is great close to subway and other things. Apartment clean. I just have some problem with communication. They don’t respond one question and are slow. Also I have problem with other people in another room, they had a discussion in the dorm in the night. But I recommend the place for few days.",3
"Great option if you need minimal accommodations in Manhattan. The location is excellent, right in Hell's Kitchen. The room and bed were comfortable, the shared bathroom and shower were nice, and everything was very clean. There are a few short flights of stairs up and down to get to the apartment, some of which are pretty tight, so keep that in mind when booking. I would definitely stay here again!",5
Wonder host and very convenient place !,5
"Michelle & Adam’s place was very clean and had everything we needed. Check-in was a little confusing, but Adam ran over to make sure we were able to get in okay. Location is super convenient, great food options everywhere.",4
"Adam's place is definitely in a good location, which is Hell's Kitchen. The house is also clean, including the bathroom. Adam is very helpful and responsive. Two problems: The first is that the location is completely different from the one reported in the listing. I had booked Adam's place to stay near Mohyninan Station and go there with my (quite bulky) suitcases on foot. Instead, I found myself on a street 25 minutes away from the station. This is not okay. You never know who will book your place: it could be someone with mobility issues or someone in a hurry to get to the station. If you don't want to give the exact address of your home, that's fine, but at least report a place one or two streets away. The second point is space. The room is really small, even if it has everything. The bed is comfortable but it is bulky. It should be replaced with a smaller one to be able to at least get out of bed and have a minimum of extra space. Translated from Italian Show original",4
"This is a good space for one person if you don't plan on staying at the Airbnb a good duration of your stay. There is many places you can go to in the area. It's very ideal if you're going to a convention at the Sheraton Hotel like I did. Keep in mind that the space is literally a bed room and there is not much space for more than just sleeping and sitting at a desk. Also, you share a kitchen space and bathroom space. This doesn't bother me, but for some who don't want to share a space then you would not like this space. I would not suggest the space for anybody with any type of mobility restrictions. Otherwise, it's great if you literally just need a place to sleep. The hosts are very kind, welcoming and accommodating.",5
"Incredible location! Lots to do around the area, close to Central Park. Place was very clean.",5
"The location is superb, the room is very small but clean. It was noted that there is a kitchen but it is not really a kitchen, it is a 5 foot wide wall with a stove and microwave. I'm afraid there is no comfortable place to sit down to eat Translated from Hebrew Show original",4
"The stay was amazing, and Adam was friendly, very welcoming, and willing to work with you.",5
The check in process was really smooth! The Airbnb was very clean as well.,5
"It is an excellent place with an excellent location, 100% recommended for a good trip in NYC Translated from Spanish Show original",5
Great place to stay in the city center! I recommend it to others! 🙂🗽,5
good place to be and very good room.,5
Great place in a good location!,5

"Very well located room to discover the city (bar, restaurant, metro and bus) and secure. Quiet in relation to the street, at the back of a building, with shared bathroom and kitchenette. Very responsive host and clear instructions Translated from French Show original",5
10/10 cozy and comfy,5
"Clean accommodation with comfortable bedding and conveniently located. On the other hand, basement rooms with very cramped window, dark room (not reported in the listing). Good communication until we entered the accommodation, then the request we addressed to them went unanswered. Our messages weren't read because we were receiving automated messages that didn't answer our question at all. It's a shame but overall for what's being done in NYC was fine. Translated from French Show original",3
"the place is perfect if your plan is just to get to sleep as in my case, it was clean, the bed big and very suitable to go out to the bars and walk back, I would stay again Translated from Spanish Show original",5
"The apartment was very small but cozy with an excellent location it was very easy to move around the area there are many restaurants and tourist areas. The cleanliness was good and the place was quiet, the only thing that caught our attention and that made us not be able to rest is that through our bedroom there were some red tubes and they were very hot so the room was very hot, we put on the air conditioning and that helps a lot , but at night the noise and it cooled a lot , but if we took it off, it felt like boiling the room for the same thing that was small . I think those rich could be dangerous if one day they break and the heat they generate was the only thing we didn't like . Outside, everything was perfect Translated from Spanish Show original",4
"John was very responsive, friendly, attractive and helpful - he helped me when there were any problems, he shared his clothes with me when my luggage was lost by the airline. Thank him so much for the morning coffee and dinner offerings, it felt like home. Pristine clean everywhere at apartments, large mirrors (quite important for woman)",5
"Johnny is a fab host! The host with the most! Very friendly, good listener and quick to help any way he can. The cleanest place, tasteful and cozy - like a lovely hotel, but with a friendly face around . :) Also, it’s very reassuring from the first moment you meet Johnny, that you’re in good hands, and you very safe - which is so important for a solo woman traveller. Can’t wait to visit again!",5
"John's place is an ideal spot for exploring New York City, thanks to its convenient location near Times Square. His room is one of the most beautiful Airbnb apartments I've ever stayed in! John is also an amazing host—very responsive and always ready to help.",5

"I cannot recommend this place enough. Johnny was an absolute pleasure to meet and an amazing host. As this was my first time in NY, he gave my husband and I lots of helpful advice, great restaurant recommendations, travel tips and shared his local knowledge. The location was great and the extra touches truly made a difference. We wouldn’t hesitate to stay here again and highly recommend this host to anyone looking for a wonderful Airbnb experience.",5
"10/10 would recommend! My boyfriend and I were hesitant about staying with someone in their home but I trusted all the countless reviews and we are glad we did! What a beautiful home. He even provided toiletries, a loofah ball, toothbrushes. There was an arctic blast one day and he offered all sorts of his personal cold weather items for us to borrow for the day. Great location, friendly but not too friendly host, beautiful place. Would definitely stay with John again!",5
"If I could give 10 stars I would! The location was perfect for touring different parts of the city, the subway and mass transit was close by. Many many places were walkable! John was a fantastic host/person. We enjoyed his conversation and company. The space is exactly as described - comfortable bed and extremely clean. Very up to date and comfortable to be in all the spaces. Would highly recommend and would only stay here if back in NYC.",5
"Being at Jonnie’s apartment is that feeling at home. All details have been taken it account and it’s very easy to share the apartment with him. In 15-20min walking you are already at Times Square, Central Park and main city sites",5
"Solo female traveler that could not have had a better experience staying with John. He was helpful, clean, has a beautiful space, is an easy roommate, and was the perfect combination of available and respectfully private. The bed is very comfortable. The neighborhood was perfect for going uptown or downtown, and right off the subway. Staying with John was a large part of having a wonderful trip. Highly recommend.",5
"Sharing a bathroom with a host is not common, but with John, it works just fine. The bathroom is away from either bedroom so you don’t feel like you’re intruding on his space. John is very friendly and very helpful. The apartment is a short walk to a wide range of restaurants and easily walkable to the Broadway theater district and Times Square.",5
"12 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · November 2025 We loved Johnny’s beautifully appointed and spacious apartment. Our room was quiet, we loved having a ceiling fan and a comfortable bed.

"This was our first time staying at an Airbnb with the host living on-site, so we weren’t sure what to expect. Based on the reviews, we decided to give it a try—and I’m so glad we did! Johnny made us feel completely at home. He and his place are both wonderful. We had plenty of privacy, yet he was also a joy to chat with. We’ll definitely stay with him again the next time we’re in New York. Couldn’t recommend him more highly!",5
"Beautiful apartment and first class host, really enjoyed our stay, couldnt fault it. Great location, I was doing the NY marathon and it was close to the pickup for the start and close to the finish. Johnny was a fab host and lovely to chat to, he gave us great recommendations for places to eat and we would happily go back and stay with him again.",5

There is so much to say about John. It can be a little scary staying in a place with a host and might feel awkward but John was absolutely amazing from the start and treated me with respect and made me feel right at home. He was always down for chatting while also giving me my space too. The bed and the private space was perfect and I’m so thankful for that. I travel to the city often so it’s nice to have a home away from home. I reccomend staying with him! I will again for sure.,5
Alex was an amazing host and very helpful. Check-in and Check-out was super easy and flexibel. I could even leave my luggage in his apartment. Everything was very clean and the room was perfect. It is easy to get to NYC and back. Very quiet and nice neighborhood. It was perfect!,5
"We had a wonderful stay in Weehawken! The room was very clean, cozy, and exactly as described. The location is perfect — it only takes about 15 minutes by bus to get directly into New York City. The connections were excellent; it felt like buses were running at any time, which made getting around incredibly easy. Alex was very helpful, always reachable, and made everything smooth for us. We felt well taken care of at all times. A truly great place to stay for a New York visit — we would definitely come back and highly recommend this accommodation!",5
"Alex and his mum Natalia are excellent hosts. I really appreciated the transport directions from JFK which were so easy to follow . Warm welcome and polite. Great views nearby overlooking the Hudson River , and great walks, lovely neighbourhood , but not much else to do in Weehawken. Great bus service to NYC so worth it. I would recommend for a safe, value stay.",5
"Alex place is great for short-medium stays! The apartment is nice, clean, functional, and it is close to the bus stations (across the street or two block away) that take you to NY. The bathroom is super clean, the kitchen has things you might need to fix some meals. The room is simple but perfect for sleeping and rest after long days exploring the city. The apartment is shared but Alex allows you to have your full privacy. The street outside is a bit busy, but doesn’t bother me at all, conversely gives a lot of options of small groceries, restaurants and cafes nearby. In general, I really felt at home and I recommend this place without hesitation.",5
"Our stay at this lovely home was truly wonderful. The hosts were exceptionally accommodating and responsive, and the space was exactly as described: clean, and comfortable. We felt right at home from the moment we arrived and would highly recommend this property to anyone looking for a great place to stay. The neighborhood is vibrant and lively, and the street can be a bit busy and sometimes a little noisy. Highly recommend!",5
"10 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · 5 days ago Easy to get there and clean. he always be responsible for everything.",5
"Great accomodation, like at home, very close to Manhaten by bus, 15 min drive, peacefull. Warmly reccomend.",5
"Lovely stay at Alex's place, tidy apartment. Alex was very helpful too.",5
"Thank you very much for the pleasant stay. The contact was very friendly, reliable, and full of helpful information.",5
"Easy to get to and from manhattan by bus or ferry. Was a great stay for an affordable price, would stay again!",5
"Alex's place was clean and bright, with a comfy bed. Communication was excellent from beginning to end. The neighborhood was was a little noisy at night, but nothing too bad.",5
"Alex is great and helpful. He recommended me some great local places and answered all my questions with explanations. The only disadvantage of this place is the location. For the first time in NYC, it was really hard to understand the bus system between NY and Weehawken. I took the wrong bus twice. So it's more disadvantage of the complicated transportation system than to Alex's place. But the view on Manhattan in NJ is worth seeing. So beautiful! Overall, it's a good, decent place for its money",5
"The stay was overall positive. The house was very clean, and the room was cozy, fully meeting our expectations. Communication with the host was initially not optimal but improved over the course of our stay. At first, a comment about our origin left us somewhat puzzled, but the interaction became more cordial afterward. A special thanks to Natalia, who was very kind and helpful, providing valuable assistance where Alex encountered some difficulties.",4
I had a wonderful stay with Alex. Everything was as described and clean. Alex responds very quickly. It is not far to Manhattan by bus to the Port Authority Bus Terminal.,5
"Alex and his Mum were welcoming hosts. I felt comfortable and at home. The place was really clean and tidy, quiet too - suitable for people who want to be close to Manhattan but without the hustle. The apartment had everything I needed and Alex was about if I needed to ask anything. 🙌",5
Very comfortable and peaceful neighbourhood. Feels like home. 10 minutes away from NYC by ferry. Alex is really helpful and nice. Would love to stay at his place again if I visit NYC in future.,5
Great location and amazing views of Manhattan just 5 minutes walking,5
"3 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · November 2025 When I checked in at the accommodation, he carried my luggage, and he responded quickly to questions, so it was comfortable to stay. Unlike the New York accommodation, the windows could be opened, so ventilation was possible and I was able to stay comfortably. It took about 15 minutes to get to Manhattan, New York by nj transit bus. It took about 5 to 10 minutes on foot from the bus stop, so it was quite convenient to get around. (When I got off the bus, I was able to see the wonderful Manhattan view) The accommodation was clean, and there was a wardrobe, so I had a comfortable stay. Recommended for visiting Manhattan on a small budget. Translated from Korean Show original",5
"6 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · August 2025 Really kind and welcoming host. And the room and town were great as well!",5
"Alex was a great host, responds quickly and helps with all questions It's in a great location, easy access to the subway and buses. Everything was clean and organized. I would definitely stay again. Translated from Portuguese Show original",5
"Great place, always clean and calm. Would 100% recommend !",5
Very nice place… the location is superb,5
"Fantastic stay! Alex was quick to respond to any inquiry, and his place is exactly as advertised. There were really no downsides beside the place not being super close to downtown New York (but commute is easy and relatively fast). Its a very cosy, suburban and quiet location, ideal for people like me who also want to get away from the hustle and bustle of the big city at night. Thank you again for the hospitality!",5
we stayed six nights for our first visit to NYC. The quick and frequent bus connection (less than half an hour to Times Square) was very comfortable. We liked the neighborhood with many latino shops and restaurants and the great view of the skyline of Manhattan. The appartment was clean and as expected. The opportunity of using the kitchen especially for breakfast was another advantage. We would stay there again.,5
"Room was convenient to time square and subway (about 10 min walk ) . Room was on the smaller side , but clean , and def the best priced we could find for location . Wish it would’ve had a mini fridge/microwave but other than that no complaints . Check in / check out super convenient and the self storage option was nice for before and after checkout .",5
Very small room but was good for an intimate weekend. Very little privacy for the bathroom so better for single travelers or couples. Early check in fee was $59 and a hold for twice that was out on my account before I left. The location was excellent just steps from both shows we saw on broadway and our restaurants and bars in Hell’s Kitchen,4
"Easy check in & out. It was nice to have to have our luggage stored after checkout. Further out from Times Square but maybe a good thing because it might have been noisier. Wish we had breakfast at hotel. My only issue was we could smell smoking everywhere to include our room which was supposed to be smoke free. Room size was good considered all rooms In NYC will be small. Overall, we just had to get past the smoke to enjoy our stay.",3
"The hotel is definitely in a good location, you’re not in a crowded area but you also aren’t far from times square. The room i stayed in definitely had some wear and tear, and the shower floor has some mild staining. the room is a decent size and the ability to open the windows was a plus. Overall this was a decent stay.",4
"10/10 experience. Really enjoyed my stay at this hotel. It’s well located, the staff was kind and helpful, and the overall experience was great. I’d definitely stay here again whenever I’m back.",5
"While the room was smaller than expected, especially with the bed down, the experience improved significantly after we were moved. Our first room had some issues with the TV, bed, and a missing color wheel, but the new room on a higher floor offered amazing NYC views. The tv was as described on TikTok and the color wheel was amazing. The bed was very comfortable and warm for the winter days , and we liked having control over the thermostat and seeing the weather displayed. But other than that when we got everything the way we liked in our new room the price was good.",4
"My stay was fantastic! The room was beautiful, the view (19th floor) was breathtaking. Hotel workers were very helpful to get me to and from places, they offered recommendations and were there when I needed something.. Restaurant food & drinks were tasty.",5
"Our room was small, but nice. The staff were helpful and the location was great. The bed was very comfy! The only issue I had was that the bathroom door would not shut entirely and there was no way to lock the door which was very strange. It would just slowly roll open while using the toilet.",4
"This building truly stands out as one of the best places to stay in New York. The views are absolutely stunning—whether day or night, they capture the beauty and energy of the city perfectly. The building is exceptionally clean and well-maintained, which immediately makes you feel comfortable and at home. Common areas are spotless, and everything feels modern and cared for. If you’re looking for a place that combines incredible views with top-level cleanliness, this building is an excellent choice.",5
"The location of Yotel is perfect to get around to anywhere you need to go in NY,NY. The room could use updating. The shower and toilet could have been cleaner. We sat to eat our food at a long table where people were just on the their computers not eating. We were told you could only sit there if you ate their cafe food.....no one else was even partaking in the restaurant. Felt a bit ridiculous for having spent $700 on a room. It was okay. Best thing was the location. The staff in lobby was great too.",3
Great location and the room was clean. Only thing was they did not have a microwave and the ice machine didn’t work. The hotel is a great walking distance to a lot of places!,4
"We thoroughly enjoyed our 1 night “pre-cruise” stay. Super clean and comfortable. Staff was excellent. Room is very small and minimalistic yet functional. The bed frame is the adjustable kind which makes sense in the space…. Would work perfectly in a stateroom. Happy Family is an authentic Asian restaurant in walking distance. We also walked to Target, a diner for brunch and the dock with luggage… specifically Pier 88. Will def be back especially if porting out of Manhattan! They also offer “lay-over” stays. Which may come in handy when traveling for work.",5
"Great location and walkable to so much around Times Square, including the subway system. The Yobot, automated robot, for baggage wasn't working when we needed it so we had to pay three dollars per bag to store it for the day.",5
"Everything went smooth so smooth, location was perfect to get around the city easily and great places to grab a quick bite all around. Great for a first time trip to New York. Definitely recommend.",5
Walking distance from Times Square. Tons to do. While space was limited the use of the space was great. Really didn’t feel as small as it was. We were really only there to sleep and shower.,4
Great stay. Room is small but we still had plenty of room for two. And we were out in the city until it was time to sleep so it worked perfectly. I did order some food from the restaurant the first night which was so delicious - Asian chicken lettuce wraps. So good and great service.,5
"The space was fine, tiny as expected, but ran into multiple issues and never received any messages back. Paid for late checkout and was still approached by staff asking why we were still there. Was told we had to pay for luggage storage even the message said otherwise. An elevator was down so took 15 minutes just to leave with a packed elevator down.",3
"Overall we loved the room. It is definitely tight and not very roomy but the bed was comfortable, the location is walkable to Times Square. There is no refrigerator in the room so I couldn’t bring any food that requires refrigeration. And outlet by door didn’t work. But I recommend Yotel and will stay there again.",4
"Hotel is awesome at the first view, the staff was helpful at first, on the next day they became mean to me, gave me weird comments like, I told em I lost my glasses in the restaurant in response from security I got: “Congratulations”. If you are looking for a great clean rooms with awesome view but mean and unprofessional staff that’s the right place",2
Pros: Location was easy to find & check in was easy with self serving kiosks. Very walkable and easy to access public transportation. Small and cozy which was perfect because we primarily just slept prior to exploring. Bed was comfortable and adjustable and WiFi was good. Cons: No responses at all via Airbnb. Our thermostat was out so we weren’t able to adjust the temperature. There were fruit flies coming in from the tiny shower vent. The luggage storage was not free and was $3 per item. No access to water/ice on any of the floors except one but the water was brown - not drinkable. We had to go all the way to the gym to access some water.,3
"Great hotel! Walkable distance to time square! our room had a beautiful view of the city, overall the room was a perfect size for 2. Would def book again when in nyc 🫶🏽",5
"Definitely we’ll be staying again! Had such a good time I might move here lol Staff was chill, easy going. I forgot the guy who checked us in but was chill and straightforward with check in and out process. Parking staff was fire too! Was chill, straight in and out!",5
Wife and I went there for a long weekend. Lots to do within walking distance. Rooms are small just like showed in the pictures but I was expecting that. They were pretty clean and bed was comfortable. Overall I would definitely stay here again if we go back to manhattan.,4
This is the second time we’ve stayed here and we love it. The restaurant has good food and yummy drinks too. Check in and check out is so simple. The room is always very clean and tidy.,5
I enjoyed the stay very much . Everything wa nearly perfect . I only rated it low on one score because of the noise that could be heard from my room from the street noise. But it’s New York. So I guess you can expect noise anywhere . But otherwise perfect to me. Grateful for the accommodations. Tons of snacks in the lobby store .,5
It was a very convenient location just 2 stops away from Manhattan and 2 blocks away from the subway station. The hotel was clean and the staff was super friendly. The only thing I wish had an improvement was the AC/Heat because it was super loud when it was on. Other than that it was great and I would stay again.,5
"We honestly got such a great deal for this stay, the subway is literally around the corner and its THE MOST cost effective way to see the most for your money. Yes the tv channels are limited and yes you can hear outside the door in the morning but honestly for the value, comfort, and cleanliness as well as distance to the subway I WILL be back to stay here.",5
"It might’ve been because of the time of year, it was super cold, but the rate was so good! I paid under $100 a night for a beautiful, New, comfortable, quiet room. I was mostly in town to see Broadway shows, and so the location was very convenient, as the M train takes you to Rockefeller Center. The front desk people were very nice. The breakfast is basic, but I was happy to get some fruit and a bagel in the morning. I highly recommend this place but don’t want it to get too too popular because then the prices will go away up!",5
"Great place! A cheap, clean stay at a convenient distance from midtown manhattan. The included breakfast was limited (as expected) but a nice touch. There’s a nice halal cart a few blocks over that’s open late.",4
"Probably one of the best hotels I’ve stayed at in my entire life and not for scenic views ( which were also pretty great from my room, but the friendly staff. All of the receptionists were extremely helpful, the neighborhood felt safe. I enjoyed my stay and will definitely stay here again.",5
"My stay at the hotel was very good and definitely worth the price I paid. Everything met my expectations, and I would happily return in the future. The only suggestion for improvement would be to offer a more diverse breakfast selection. Overall, a pleasant and comfortable experience.",4
"The room was cleaned regularly, and housekeeping always did an amazing job. Breakfast could have a few more options, as during a longer stay it can become repetitive. Overall, we were happy with our stay here. Good value for the price paid.",5
"We had a wonderful time at Wingate we loved our room which was very clean, (they clean rooms every day) and staff was always here for us. They also gave us a free late checkout and helped me find a bag I totally forgot in the room! I’d stay there again for sure!!",5
"My stay at the hotel was very good and definitely worth the price I paid. Everything met my expectations, and I would happily return in the future. The only suggestion for improvement would be to offer a more diverse breakfast selection. Overall, a pleasant and comfortable experience.",5
Place was as advertised and clean. The area is not great and walls seem pretty thin. Wind and outdoor noise can be heard very loud in room. Aside from those couple drawbacks the stay was good and is conveniently located a couple minutes walk from the subway.,4
Clean small room but no smart TV to enjoy after a long day out. Location was not as advertised and definitely not a safe feeling area to walk back at night. Convenient if not traveling here at night other than that fairly priced for what you get.,4
the location was okay and staff were amazing close to the subway station the only thing I wish they had a smart TV since me and my partner just wanted to relax with a Christmas movie after exploring the city,4
"It was a clean hotel, and met all of our needs. The downside which was major for us, was the walk from the subway to the hotel. Super scary, didn’t feel safe at night. The hotel does not match the location.",4
"The hotel was excellent overall—clean, comfortable, and well-maintained. The staff were friendly and attentive, the amenities were convenient, and the location made it easy to get around. A great stay that offered good value for the price.",5
"Room was nice and as described. Night one the room was quite cold and took awhile to heat up and the how water ran out very quick, but was not an issue the rest of the stay. Would stay again.",5
"This place was great to stay at for a last minute getaway. There was free breakfast, complimentary tea, coffee and water at all times of the day. The room was very clean and was cleaned everyday we left to adventure New York. The area outside was not very safe to be walking around but the subway was less than five minutes away so it was a great location to get where we needed to go!",5
"Great visit, it had exactly what we were looking for a 1 night stay. The unit is spacious and modern. Having a mini fridge is always a plus. Love that you can go downstairs for breakfast and you can also buy snacks and drinks downstairs if needed. What could have been better were that there were a few stains on multiple towels that we did not use yet. Also the TV did not work as intended.",4
"I love view, and they offer room service every day which is awesome, also the staff was friendly and was able to provide the room with amazing views as requested. One suggestion is to change the menu of breakfast items or include pancakes or live waffles station if possible and improve the weekday timings until 10AM as well.",4
"My best friend and I were not expecting much when we booked this room last minute, but boy were we pleasantly surprised! We had a beautiful room on the 8th floor with a view of the city that was to die for. The room was cozy yet spacious with a subtle modern feel. We could not get over the quality of the room for the price we paid! 10/10 would recommend and stay again.",5
Great place to stay on a budget the location isn't great and isn't as close to time square as it says but for the price can't complain. TV wasn't a smart to so little disappointed in the selection. However I had a late flight on the last day and was able to get checkout for 2pm free of charge so was very happy with the customer service and the host replies very quick with any queries.,4
"Great Value and Clean Stay I had a great stay at Wingate by Wyndham LIC. The room was clean, modern, and comfortable. Staff were friendly and helpful, and the location made getting to Manhattan easy. The neighborhood isn’t super lively, but I felt safe overall. Definitely good value for the price! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️☆ (4/5)",5
"The hotel is really cute and clean the hot water pressure and the hot water are amazing. That’s a big plus for me. The rooms were immaculate. The staff was very friendly. Check-in was easy, your 2 1/2 blocks away from the subway train which is very convenient you are not close to anything walkable with restaurants or food, but I had planned on going into the city so I would definitely stay again. The bed was amazing. During the day there is the hustle and bustle of New York City on the outside but at night it’s very quiet so we got a lot of rest. We enjoyed our stay. Friendly hosts quick to respond.",5
At first I was speculative about the neighborhood. Once we ventured out and began taking the subway living like a local we realized how peaceful it actually was. How may others staying in close by neighborhoods were doing the same. Can’t experience New York if you don’t travel like them. Breakfast was served every morning and flexible. Although it was a very limited variety you could still be sure you ate your fill. Fresh towels and house keeping was very polite and trustworthy. We forgot a bag and had made it to Nashville already and received a call that we had left it. Would definitely stay there again,5
"A very nice hotel , clean big rooms, nice free breakfast and helpful staff 24 hour front desk service who even replaced the coffee maker for me at 4 am when , due to jet lag, I wanted to have a coffee and the existing machine had died !",5
Very nice and as expected. Nice clean hotel with all the expected amenities. No issues checking in. Hotel provides everything you need. Subway station was very easily accessible to get into manhattan.,5
"The hotel and the staff were great. It’s is new, modern, clean, safe and quiet. The location is not the expected but I just went there to sleep and rest, perfect place to have a quiet rest. I requested an uber to get there and it was very close to where I need to be, so uber was un expensive.",5
"Loved the room. It was very clean and convenient to the subway. Breakfast options were sparse and it didn’t feel like the best part of town, but staff was friendly and th room was comfortable.",4
Stay was good and hotel itself was nice. Room was clean and comfortable. The area isn’t the nicest though. Was a bit sketchy at night as a solo female traveler. My only complaint about hotel itself is that my room was right next to the cleaning/staff room. They were very loud talking and moving stuff super early in the morning and woke me up a few times. It was very annoying and I’d request a different room away from their station if I stayed here again.,4
"The hotel room was very clean and comfortable to stay in. I also liked that the subway was really close by! Not the greatest breakfast food, but that was the least of my worries honestly. I would definitely stay here again!",5
"Issue with my stay. Wouldn’t advise staying here. I was repeatedly given conflicting information by the staff, which made the experience frustrating and confusing. When I asked to speak with a manager, I was consistently told they were in a meeting, and no one could say when the meeting would end or when the manager would be available. The lack of transparency and accountability was very disappointing.",1
We had a great time . I like the location is easy to move around. Staff members were supper friendly. Thank you for everything,5
"Everything was good until I turned on the television, it should have internet connection to the television for the priced asked",5
"Bathroom is clean and nice. The location is great, you’re super close to the station and it’s truly ideal. I think a lot of the comments about the location are snobbish. There is a children’s school right around the corner, it is a safe area. I have a feeling what’s making some people uncomfortable is the color of the neighborhood and the clear lack of money being implemented to update more of the area (without inconveniencing the current residents) Wifi is really bad and I kept getting cut off during an important meeting. Unfortunately, although most of the staff was fine, a younger employee (we were told his name is Matthew?) was extremely rude. He consistently ignored me when I went down to ask for help and then again when I asked for assistance purchasing an item from their shop.",2
"1 year on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · 3 weeks ago 100% worth it... the subway is a 5 minute walk away, the free breakfast is quite good. All in all, a great place to stay at.",5
"My friend and i stopped at this hotel for 1 night.The room was good,spacious and clean.The hotel location was very convenient,it took us only 20min to get to Manhattan by subway.The staff was friendly and the neighborhood seemed fine,like a regular big city neighborhood. We did have few issues though. At the moment of reservation I made sure to ask about the bed size(in the designation it was advertised as king size bed),I was reassured the bed is king size.When we arrived we realized the bed was queen size.When i asked the front desk about it,they told me ""all our beds are queen size,you have a king size room"".Interesting wording.Another thing- the most important thing for me is parking.Again,the hotel advertised they do have parking available on the premises with another Interesting wording for that.And to be fair,they do have parking, but it's only 7-8 spots right in front of the building.We were lucky enough to have 1 free spot and leave our car there.I guess it's NewYork.",4
"2 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · January 2026 Great stay overall! The place was clean, comfortable, and exactly as described. Communication with the host was easy and smooth. Would happily stay again.",5
"Comfortable place to stay, near subway station and places to grab a bite to eat. Lobby has a small convenience store, came in super handy. Would stay again!",5
Area felt a bit sketchy at first but it ended up being ok. Nice staff and room for the price !,5
"Room was amazing, bathroom was huge and the view we had was breathtaking. They had house keeping and were super nice",5
"Not the best area but far from the worst, worth the price and couldn’t complain about anything else. Great stay would do again",5
the place was great clean and comfortable breakfast in the morning was amazing they b ave all various foods . accessible to hot teas coffee and water .,5
"The host was extremely responsive, even replying promptly at 3am when our flight was delayed and we had to request a late check in",5
"12 years on Airbnb Rating, 4 stars , · December 2025 Great value and very clean hotel. You get what you pay for, however only 24min from Grand Central !!",4
"place was fine. nothing fancy, but a nice place to stay. close to the subway station so very easy to get into manhattan",4
"Perfect and strategic, safe and easy to find . Friendly staff, clean and comfortable. Highly recommend",5
"Loved our stay, hotel and room was great. Neighborhood was alright but subway station was nearby to easily commute.",5
Walkable distance from subway 🚇 station and the best part was complementary breakfast 🥞🍳,4
"I’ve been to NYC multiple times and wanted to bring my birthday in this year. I don’t expect perfection but I at the minimum expect to be placed In a comfortable, welcoming and honest environment. I asked did we have a city view on check his. He said no , your code does not qualify and we are sold how. Can I upgrade? Not today we are all sold out? Get to the room, temp 72, cannot adjust thermostat, TV does not work, and placed in handicapped while water leaked all over the restroom floor. Contacted host and response…. Very disappointing, inconsiderate and sort of dismissive. I’ve never experienced this in any of rentals especially NYC my favorite place to be",2
The cleaning lady broke the shower door leaving glass everywhere. They did not clean it till the next day. I ended up stepping on glass days after. I contacted the chat line and they said they can’t do anything about it. Unfair and unsanitary.,1
Very friendly and helpful. Even let us to left luggage behind in their storage for a few hours after check out.,5
Nice stay for the budget and you get free breakfast. Really close distance to the subway,5
Great clean hotel 5 minute walk to the subway that takes you anywhere you want to go.,5
We loved the bathroom and the breakfast. Overall it was a great stay ! Thanks:),5

"Solid hotel stay, perfect for what I needed being close to Manhattan & also LGA as well as close enough to the F train.",5
"Easy to get to Manhattan, lots of great places close by and great restaurants and bars",5
"Definitely the best hotel to stay at in the area, very close to the subway so travel around the city is easy, good view of the skyline from the higher floors",4
Great hotel with very friendly staff. Everything was spotless. The neighborhood was a little out of my comfort zone but I still felt safe at the hotel.,5
Place was extremely nice and our room was great. Very clean. The prices for hotels/airb&b in New York are completely overpriced in general.,5
Got lucky with last minute booking on this nice hotel close to NYC. Included breakfast was much appreciated!,5
A great stay for a couple of days with pretty easy transportation options. Good value for a clean hotel room and breakfast.,5
"Nice place, very clean, breakfast is ok considering the price of this place it’s a good value. My only problem was I was charged randomly on my card and no one knew what it was. Hotel had no explanation, host had no explanation and I’m waiting on it to be returned to my card.",3
"my travels coming in were delayed and quite chaotic. when i arrived a day late to my 4 night reservation hoping for some relief i was told that my entire reservation was cancelled. no refund, even after getting paying for insurance on the reservation. the handling of this whole situation was terrible. payed 1000$+ for a headache.",1
Such a great place and location! Would definitely come back to stay again,5

It was a good place to stay at.,5
Great room and location. 100% would stay again,5
Best places to go if you go to New York😍,5
"Excellent price, close to a metro stop and 2 or 3 stops from Manhattan, the included breakfast buffet can save you a lot of money. We ordered a lot of packages from Amazon and they all arrived without a problem. The front desk is responsible for receiving packages regardless of whether you are in the hotel. The room and cleanliness are a total luxury for the price. I would come back! Translated from Spanish Show original",5
"The breakfast for a whole week is the same (eggs) it has no variations at all, the juice tastes like pure water and the area feels a little unsafe outside, the cleaning is done badly, they do not change sheets or collect garbage such as labels or empty packaging that are on the floor or in the trash can Translated from Spanish Show original",2

"I had amazing days in this place. Gratitude to the entire team, who are very well prepared and very pleasant.

If you want great value and a good location, this is perfect. Translated from Portuguese Show original",5
Overpriced but otherwise good.,4
"Excellent hotel, the room is not the biggest but it perfectly meets everything, very good to have a desk, the bathroom was always clean and the towels and sheets are changed daily, breakfast is not premium but it is very good, the area is not the most beautiful but it is quiet, and there are a couple of restaurants and shops open 24 hours in addition to being very close to the subway.

Given how close you are to central Manhattan - walkable to Rockefeller etc. this place is a fantastic stay and worked fabulously for a work trips. The room had great heating (given the subzero temperatures) and was very clean and accommodating. Very friendly cat Dracula was beyond hospitable - overall really convenient stay - Thank you so much Monica!,5
"The host was super sweet and helpful, it was very clean and comfortable. Super close to everything, for me the nightclub was tolerable and I have nothing negative to say. Plus a cute cat :)",5

"Monica was an amazing host! I have never had a host so responsive. Her place was so clean and convenient to everything. She even let me keep my bags at her place since I had a late flight. I didn’t have to stress about anything. Thanks, Monica! I will stay here again!",5

"The building (hallways) itself could use a little more love but inside her unit was perfectly clean. love the exposed brick in the room and the bathroom was very clean as well. Water pressure was amazing and endless hot water which I loved! If Im visiting NY alone again, I would definitely stay here again!",5
"I had a great stay at Monica’s place in Hell’s Kitchen! The apartment was spotless and had everything I needed for a comfortable stay. The location is perfect—close to great restaurants, shops, and within easy walking distance to many of New York’s top attractions. Monica was a thoughtful and responsive host, which made the experience even better. I’d definitely recommend this spot to anyone visiting the city!",4
"9 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · March 2025 I loved this place! Monica is super nice, location is perfect Seeing the previous reviews here, I was worried about noise from Times Square, but it was very quiet and easy to sleep And normally, I’m a very very picky and sensitive sleeper and tells others to turn off light and sound around me when I sleep",5
Monica was super friendly and helpful The apartment was super clean and cute It was also near a lot to do We had a great time! Her cat Dracula was also adorable ☺️,5
"Amazingly perfect. I felt home by having a great bed, AC and nice bathroom! Would love to go back again !",5
Had a great stay in NYC. Very convenient location and accommodating host. Just watch out for the cat!!! He’s lovely but persistent.,5
"I had a great stay at Monica’s place this week. The room was perfect—comfortable and just a short 15-minute walk to the Javits Center and Times Square. I even randomly came across the red carpet premiere for the F1 movie in Times Square, which was a cool surprise! Monica’s cat was super friendly and would greet me every time I came back. On my last day, it was even hanging out by my window. If you’re looking for a simple, affordable spot close to a lot of NYC sights, I’d definitely recommend staying here.",5
"Monica’s place was super clean, easy to get to, and extremely close to all the Broadway Theatres. The cat was really sweet. A great value compared to all the Times Square hotels.",5
"I had such a wonderful time at Monica's. . I really loved the bed, especially after many hours on the flight, that comfortable bed was really needed. I was very well received by Monica and Dracula whom we just connected instantly!!! Monica was so welcoming and supportive. Her place is in a very good location and easy to locate. what touched me most was when she agreed to keep my luggage after check out!!.. I was so touched because it's rare to find understanding hosts... Thank you so much Monica, I had such a great time and I will sure be back!!!",4
"Monica was a lovely host, as was her cute feline Niño! Great communication, I felt right at home, and it was central and walkable to Broadway & Times Square! Cute spot, would def come back! x",5
The location was great and Monica was very responsive and helpful. I enjoyed my stay.,5
"I stayed at Monica’s Airbnb for 11 nights and had a wonderful time in New York. The room was charming and perfect for a longer stay – especially with the lovely company of Monica’s sweet and friendly cat. The shared bathroom was cleaned daily, and the entire apartment felt very clean and well-maintained. Although there is a club nearby, I never found the music to be loud or disturbing – I didn’t even need the earplugs that were provided. As a solo female traveler, I found the neighborhood to be absolutely safe and comfortable – I always felt at ease. Monica was a very kind and helpful host. I can warmly recommend this place to anyone!",5
"We had such a great time at Monica’s. Perfect place to rest and relax after a long day walking around. It was super cozy and felt like home, also don’t be afraid of shared spaces, we met some nice people!",5
"4 years on Airbnb Rating, 4 stars , · December 2025 It is located 10-15 minutes from the center of Times Square, so it is accessible. The room was tidy, the bed was fluffy, and the blankets were clean, so I was able to sleep comfortably. There's a little breeze through the window, but if you close the curtains and turn on the fan, it's warm. The cat is also completely cute. I had a good time for a week! Translated from Korean Show original",4
"Great apartment in a perfect location! The cost is reasonable, and the overall living experience has been excellent!",5
"Hell's Kitchen Launchpad-- I stayed 3 nights in the private room (lockable door) inside Monica's second story apartment. She was flexible and let me drop off my bags several hours before official check in time. She buzzed me in and hand delivered the keys I'd need and made sure I knew what went where etc. Bed and pillows etc were very comfortable (not cheap). Monica is available but not lurking--if you need her, she's there but otherwise you probably won't see her, even though there's a shared bathroom. Her cat Dracula is a clear bonus...he's happy to meet you in the morning and have some scritches. As for the location...you're in a typical Manhattan neighborhood, which means you're not far from wherever you want to go. The 50th St subway station is a comfortable 8-ish minute walk. Tons of restaurants in the immediate area. Very comfortable property for one traveler. Highly recommended.",5
"My stay was amazing, Monica was always available and available for any questions, doubts or concerns I had. I was allowed to leave my bags both before check-in and after check-out. I highly recommend this place because of its excellent location and because it has everything you may need. The cat Dracula was very loving and playful, I will have to come back to see him again 🤭 Translated from Spanish Show original",5
"We really enjoyed our stay. The space was very clean, cozy, and well organized, and the location was perfect. Check-in was easy and the host was very responsive and helpful. We felt comfortable the entire time and would happily recommend this place to others.",5
"Paula's place is a great alternative to the criminally high hotel prices in Manhattan. It's an excellent location, with easy access to public transportation, and lots of shops and restaurants right below you on the street level. We loved that there was a coffee shop on either side of the building entrance! No shortage of morning caffeination! Paula is a delightful person and made sure we had everything we needed for our stay. She was very responsive to communication and gave detailed instructions. Thanks for everything, Paula! Happy Holidays!",5
Paula’s apartment is very well located. Plenty of restaurants and convenience stores nearby and well connected with public transportation. Apartment and the guest room is spacious for one person.,4
"Paula was always kind and friendly, which made me feel at ease. It's a very accessible location within walking distance of Times Square. Although it faces a major street, noise wasn't much of an issue, allowing for a relaxing stay.",5
"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ 5/5 – Amazing Stay in Hell’s Kitchen with a Fantastic Host I had a wonderful stay at Paula’s place in Hell’s Kitchen! The location is unbeatable close to everything you could want in Manhattan, including Times Square, Broadway theaters, Central Park, and so many great restaurants and bars right around the corner.",5
"The location was AMAZING!!!!! Just a few blocks from Times Square, Central Park, all Broadway shows, and a MTA station was around the corner. The room & bathroom were extremely clean, and the apartment as a whole was HUGE by NYC standards. Obviously you're sharing the space with Paula, so you'll probably see/hear her in the kitchen or living room. The ONLY thing that posed an issue was the front door key; it was extremely touchy & very difficult to unlock the front door.",5
"I had a truly wonderful stay! The apartment was clean, well-equipped, and incredibly comfortable. It’s been a while since my last time in New York, but I felt completely at home here — thanks to Paula's kindness and attention to detail. Highly recommended and would love to stay again!",5
"Paula's place was perfect for me! Simple, clean and in a great location! I will definitely stay there again!",5

Quick and painless. The room is very cute and very clean. Centrally located to where I needed to go. Thanks for an easy stay!,5
"Paula was a wonderful host, and her place was amazing! Great location and clean. If given the opportunity, I would stay here again.",5
Paula was lovely and an attentive host. Any time I texted her she responded right away. The apartment was impeccably clean. The only problem was the air conditioner in the window did not really put out a lot of cool air! But it was quite hot the past three days that I stayed there.,5
"Absolutely wonderful stay! The location was perfect—right in the heart of downtown. The space was clean, comfortable, and exactly as described. The host was friendly, responsive, and made everything easy. Would definitely stay here again!",5
"Top location, very close to Times Square. Cute little room, window with a view into a kind of air shaft, which is not bad, but very quiet. The bed was very comfortable, good mattress. The bathroom was also clean and we were allowed to use the kitchen. Paula is a very friendly hostess, she gave us good tips for excursions and was easy to contact if we had any questions. We would recommend the accommodation again at any time and would be happy to come back. :)",5
"Paula was a welcoming host. The apartment was impeccably clean and the room well-appointed. If you are looking for a small but convenient, comfortable and clean place to stay this should be a good match.",5

"4 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · April 2025 Paula was a great host. Friendly helpful and relaxed. The space was very clean and well positioned in the heart of hells kitchen. I’d recommend Paula’s place to stay if you want to be in NYC. Be aware that it’s a walk up. Thanks Paula.",5
Cozy bedroom with a fantastic mattress. Host was very responsive and very helpful. Host was flexible with my ever changing schedule at checkin! Would definitely stay again!,5
"Very clean and cozy little spot in a great location. The building was secure and I didn't mind at all that it was a 4th floor walk-up. A few blocks from the trains and a short ride to Penn Station, Central Park, and other attractions. Plenty of good places to eat in the neighborhood. Paula was a great hostess. Very communicative, helpful, and hospitable. We were there at the same time, but we were never in each other's way as I was out and about anyway. Would definitely stay again.",5
"9 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · March 2025 Very very close to Times Square, and located on the 9th avenue where there are a lot of restaurants/bars nearby. The place itself is also great; clean and exactly what it looks like in the pictures. The host was also nice and responds very quickly :)",5
Easy stay! Close to everything.,5
"Paula thank you so much for your great hosting!!! I had such a great time at Paula's place! Paula kept communicating with me and gave me clear instructions of the address. I was deeply touched when Paula gracefully agreed to keep my luggage early in the morning before check-in time! Thank you so much Paula... Travelers love Flexible hosts and you are one among very few. Paula' s place is very clean and comfy. we had such a great time chatting in the evenings when both of us were at home. It's such a strategic location that is very lively.... Thank you so much Paula, I will definitely be back!!",4
"Alexander was a great host. He regularly checked in to ensure we were having a great stay. The apartment itself is beautiful. The location is great! Safe neighborhood, and stunning views. Also, the mattresses are incredibly comfy!",5
"We had an extremely positive experience at this location. The apartment is both exceptionally nice and very comfortable, offering ample space for guests. The highlight is undoubtedly the absolutely stunning view of the Manhattan skyline. The location proved convenient for utilizing the subway system. Alexander's communication was excellent, and he was highly accommodating regarding our reasonable check-in and check-out arrangements. Furthermore, the building's doormen were friendly and provided outstanding, helpful service throughout our stay. Highly recommend!",5
"We really enjoyed our stay. We loved the outdoor balcony and great view of the NY skyline. Great location, near a subway station and the bus stop that takes you to LA Guardia airport. The host was very responsive and gave great local recommendations. We highly recommend.",5
"Alexander was the most amazing host. His place was absolutely beautiful. Whether you wanna go with a special someone or friends, this is the place. Definitely would come back!",5
Beautiful home in the ideal location. Everything was perfect inside and out. We loved the view and felt so at home in Alex’s place. Great communication the entire time and nothing lacking on any front. Would be delighted to visit again.,5
"Our host was amazing, communicated so well, and we felt welcomed in the beautiful apartment. The city views and outdoor patio space are incredible, and the interior is elegantly furnished and quite comfortable. We were five family members arriving from three different states, and Alexander's apartment is the perfect gathering place. The bedrooms and living areas are spacious, with a great kitchen to prep our meals. We are already planning our next visit to New York and look forward to staying at this exceptional apartment again!",5
"We totally enjoyed our stay! Incredible view, great balcony, comfortable furniture and very comfortable beds. Our host quickly responded to any questions and was very helpful. Would definitely stay here again. 5 stars across the board!!",5

"Gorgeous place , Alexander was one of the best airbnb hosts I’ve ever had. The doorman was amazing as well. Perfectly convenient location. Loved it here",5
alex was always there for questions!! easy to check in flexible w checkout great stay great views great spot so fun,5
"Great stay- host was extremely communicative and helpful! The space was spacious and clean, as well",5
Enjoyed our stay and were made to feel welcome in a lovely atmosphere. Thanks to Alex for being communicative and accommodating!,5
Alex’s apartment was the perfect location for our family of 4 adults to stay during a celebratory weekend! We had a lovely stay and hope to return in the future!,5
"We had the absolute best time ever staying in New York, but this apartment made the trip. We were a group of 6 adults ages 70, 70, 65, 63, 42 and 36. From the moment we arrived the doorman made us feel so welcome. The beds and bedding were so comfortable, the kitchen was completely clean and stocked with whatever we needed. The bathrooms were impeccable. The terrace/deck was so comfortable and the views were indescribable. Walked to the subway was maybe a 6 minute walk through the vibrant neighborhood. We always felt safe and welcomed. The restaurants and bodegas were so delicious. We only ate in the neighborhood except for a hot dog in Central Park and pizza. I would definitely recommend this apartment to everyone and if I get another chance to visit New York I will definitely stay here again. The sanctuary of the apartment let us enjoy the go go go of New York with sightseeing and Broadway shows and we felt so comfortable and relaxed in our down time at the apartment. ⭐️ ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",5
The space is gorgeous and the subway is just a few blocks away which made my whole trip so convenient.,5
"The host warmly welcomed us, carefully explained how to use the house, and also recommended us travel guides and nearby restaurants. This house is very well located, there are many restaurants nearby and the security is very good. The house is very clean and comfortable. The bed is not too soft, very comfortable, I don't want to get up every day. If it's not too cold, the balcony will be a very suitable place to sit. The scenery is too beautiful. Next time I come to New York, I will still choose here. Translated from Chinese (Simplified) Show original",5
Great apartment and great host,5
"8 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · November 2025 Great apartment, wonderful hosts. Everything went smoothly — highly recommended.",5
great place loved staying there would do it again,5
"Lotus is a very nice host and made me feel welcome and comfortable from the very first moment. The guest room is next to a Main Street and thus it can be a bit noisy during the night. For me personally it was not a problem at all, but for sensitive people it might? Location is top, close to subway, shops and restaurants are in walking distance - can only recommend!",5
"Lotus is very nice and friendly. However, my stay was ruined by no hot water. I discovered it on day 2. Host was apparently unaware. It was never fixed. cold showers in winter is unacceptable. had to check out 2 days early. also, kitchen was too cluttered for cooking etc. no coffee maker or toaster. location is convenient as far as Harlem, but I was surprised by the prevalence of drug addicts and vagrants in the immediate vicinity. I did get refunded, thankfully.",3
"Thank you so much for your hospitality — staying in your home was a wonderful decision! The room is beautiful, with large windows and such a warm atmosphere. I will definitely come back!",5
"Loved our stay, albeit brief. Great location: easy walk to the subway, central park, and right in the middle of Harlem. Apartment (and bedroom itself) was peaceful and very quiet at night. We appreciated Lotus' hospitality - she was proactive, quick to respond, and flexible. Recommend! :)",5
The apartment is super convenient and it is right above the metro station. I arrived in NYC early and lotus was kind enough to let me store my luggage there way before the checkin time. The room feels so homey and I’ll definitely come back next time when I visit NYC,5
I had a great stay with Lotus while visting NYC to run the New York Marathon. The location was very handy for the subway and only 20 mins direct to Times Square. Lotus was very friendly and gave me great instructions and recommendations for things to do nearby and how to get there. I will definitely be back again to visit. Thank you very much for having me!,5
"Lotus was an awesome host and this was an AMAZING place to stay. Super comfy bed, spacious bathroom and communal living areas, and Lotus was always responsive from booking to checkout. The house is basically right on top of a subway station and very convenient to explore NYC from. Would happily stay again!",5
"I stayed at Yeun-Ah over 10 days as I was coming to NYC for a business trip, but also wanted to enjoy the city a little bit as a tourist. The place is very accessible, next to the subway (literally) and you can go everywhere from there. Yeun-Ah was always responsive and very helpful! Thanks so much.",5
"Lotus’s home is stunning, has so much character and is very clean and safe. The area can get noisy but you don’t hear it all from inside. For me the location is the only thing, her place is lovely and safe but the location doesn’t give that same vibe yk. But the good news is the subway is literally 1 min walk from her place as well as the shopping plaza and beautiful cafes. Central Park is also a 10 min walk from her place as well, so that’s refreshing. Lotus truly was an amazing host, making sure the heater was constantly running, the bed was the most comfortable bed I’ve slept in, the place was spotless, she made me feel very welcome and safe, and enhanced my experience in NYC!",5
"I had the most wonderful stay at this Airbnb! From the moment I arrived, the host welcomed me with such genuine warmth and kindness – she’s truly one of the sweetest and most caring people I’ve ever met. The place itself is exactly as pictured – no surprises, no disappointments. Every photo on the listing is 100% accurate: clean, beautifully decorated! The bed was incredibly comfortable, the kitchen had everything we needed. Location-wise, it doesn’t get more convenient. Just a short walk to shops, restaurants, subway– I barely needed to use rideshares. Everything felt safe and easy. I honestly can’t recommend this place enough. If you’re visiting the area, book here without hesitation.",5
"Lotus is a warm and welcoming host who prioritizes ease for her guests. The room is absolutely lovely, spacious, and comfy - the private bathroom is also spacious and was very clean. This is NYC so there are narrow stairs to consider, but if you don’t have any mobility issues, I honestly don’t know why you wouldn’t stay here. The location is great because you’re right by the 2/3 line and can get anywhere fairly easily, if that’s an important consideration for you. Highly recommend The Red Rooster which is just up the street with their jazz and gospel brunches! Plus I had such good conversation with Lotus … the next time I’m in the city I’ll definitely be staying here. This is a great spot for female solo travelers. Thank you, Lotus. 🫶🏼",5
"Lotus was such a lovely host - warm, welcoming, and flexible! Her home is beautiful and in such a convenient location (right next to a subway stop). She helped make my first visit to NYC really memorable!",5
"if you're coming to NYC you need to stay here. it was quiet, clean, you get a private bathroom, and your bedroom is huge. there's a heater AND a fan in the bedroom for whatever temperature you need the room to be. the shower is a walk in shower and very easy to operate. the m60 bus to LaGuardia AND the 125 Lenox Subway are right next to her apartment. yeun ah was so friendly, and the entire house was quiet all day and night. I can't recommend this place enough.",5
Yeun Ah made me feel right at home the moment I arrived in NYC. It was my first solo trip and she was so helpful. She made me feel right at home and was also so responsive to my questions. It definitely felt like home away from home. The house and bathroom was clean and it’s exactly what you see in the photos. The listing is close to the subway so it was really easy and accessible to get around Manhattan. I would definitely come back. Thank you for making my solo trip so memorable. ❤️,5
Lotus was always responsive and was extremely helpful and friendly. I appreciated her hospitality! Would recommend and even stay here again.,5
Great host. Lotus is very friendly. Very warm feeling. Spacious accommodation. I would definitely booked her place again.,5
The airbnb was lovely and fantastic. Close to public transporation which was a bonus. Would stay again!,5
"Great location near restaurants, shops and the subway. A very comfortable room with a great bathroom. Excellent!",5
The room is very cozy and comfortable. Location is close to metro station. Lotus is the most welcoming and helpful host. Highly recommended!,5
"Staying at Lotus's was such a wonderful experience. It didn't just feel like a place to sleep, but a home away from home. Amenities-wise and logistically speaking, I very much appreciated the pristine conditions of the place, the convenient location (a very short walk from the metro), and the very comfortable room. Staying at Lotus's helped me feel very much at ease. Further, it was great to get to interact with Lotus herself. On top of the necessary discussions about the logistics of my stay, it was wonderful to get to know Lotus on a more personal basis, and to feel like an actual home guest. This felt especially great for me, given that I was travelling solo. Highly, highly recommended!",5
I had SUCH a great visit in the city!!! Yeun-Ah is just so lovely and kind. I appreciate her so much. This was such a lovely place to visit!! Really made my trip to NYC very memorable,5
"3 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · August 2025 It was great staying at this bnb- the host was super friendly and made me feel right at home :) Quarters were clean and comfortable. I’d recommend bringing earplugs if you’re bothered by noise because there is a busy street right outside. It was very easy to catch the bus/subway to central Manhattan, would stay again.",5
"room was just as described. very aesthetic overlooking Lenox Blvd. lovely natural light and hardwood floors. great location, right in the middle of Harlem. right off the subway and easy to walk to Central Park and many Harlem restaurants and stores. Yeun-Ah was very friendly and responsive the whole time.",4
Yeun-Ahs place was a super easy hub to get around the city from. I felt at home with her and the room/bed was so comfy. The neighborhood is vibrant and safe and right off the main street of Lenox Ave is super residential beautiful too. Awesome balance. Saw so many families and dogs at Marcus Garvey park and same at Riverside park! All of 20 minutes to get down to World Trade Memorial.,5
"Great stay at an ideal location within walking distance of Times Square! Our room offered a lot of privacy and was perfect for a weekend visit. The bathroom and common spaces were clean and well maintained. Adrian was very responsive, flexible, and accommodating during our stay as well. Definitely would stay here again!",5
"Ryan's place is great - location is very central and convenient, the room/amenities are immaculate and comfortable, and he's a great communicator. Was *not* a problem, just an FYI--need to climb stairs. Would definitely stay again.",5
"Wow, wow 10/10 for great location plenty of restaurants transport all nearby Stayed for nine days very reasonably priced what more would you want for your money? Bathroom very clean everything you need as with the rest of the accommodation Thank you",5
"We loved our stay here! Perfect location- close to times square and public transportation. It also felt very safe- as two girls we weren’t sure about getting back in at night, but it was very safe & everything was great! Host was very communicative & flexible with letting us drop bags early. Would absolutely stay here again if we’re in the city!",5
"The location is really good, close to everything and there are many restaurants and shops around, which makes it quite noisy at night though. The room is a bit small for two people, I think it’s ok for just one person. Check-in was very easy and Adrian was great, always answered quickly to our questions.",4
"The location is great, the AC is strong and cools down the room within minutes, the room is as shown in the listing. Although, the 4th floor with no elevator is something to keep in mind since the staircases are narrow, it was quite a struggle to get my 40-50 pound suitcase up. Still, I’d stay there if I’m ever in New York again",5
My host was most accommodating. The room was neat and clean. The common rooms were accessible and I had everything I needed. It was also nice and quiet which I appreciate! I highly recommend this place.,5
Exactly as described & communicated very well! solved our issues right away and allowed us to leave luggage after our checkout until our flight departed! would book again !,5
It’s a great place if you’re traveling solo. The cleaner is there everyday to help maintain the common areas. It’s a great location if you’re a theatre goer as the theatre district is a block away. It’s a great place to stay but may be a little cramped for more than one guest.,4
"This is exactly as described -- a private room in a busy Manhattan neighborhood for a budget price. If a hotel costs too much and a hostel is too overwhelming, this is a middle ground.",4
Very good place if you want a place near everything. Easy to find just follow the instructions make you read and follow instructions. Very good I love it!!!,5
"Great place with an amazing location. The only issue is the noise — the window doesn’t close all the way due to airflow, so you might hear people loading and unloading from trucks at night. Other than that, Adrian is very supportive and open to negotiation. Overall, if you’re on a solo trip, this place is almost the perfect home for you in New York! — just bring some earplugs",5
"This place is perfect! I am a huge NYC/Broadway nerd and this location was perfect! Being in Hell’s Kitchen made Times Square and all the Broadway theaters within walking distance. It was really easy to go out shopping and then walk back to drop my things off and go back out. The only downfall was the 4th floor walk-up, but if that was my biggest problem, then it was a total success!",5
"Great place, affordable and worth the location and convenience!",5
We enjoyed our stay and would stay here again! The location was absolutely perfect and so convenient. Check in/out was super easy as well,5
"Very small, but ideal location, a million sights within a 10 minute walk. Shower and toilet facilities very small, Ideal if your staying solo, probably not a place for a couple No complaints, finding it and getting in very easy",4
"Easy accessible with the up to date check-in as well as rooms doors accessible through the phone with a key available as another option. It is a great location in Manhattan, room is a good size, the bed is amazing and very comfortable, I slept rally well.",5
"Great place to stay for a few nights in NYC, good location close to time square and the subway and a lot of restaurants and delis, the house was clean and nice and the check in was also very good and easy, I will definitely stay here again if Im NYC",5
"I never stayed in Hells Kitchen before, so this was my introduction. I liked it. Another distinct neighborhood on Manhattan. Walked the streets day and night, ate good food, people were lively and friendly. Adrian was a great host, which made my stay more enjoyable.",5
"Adrian was great at communicating from the very beginning! Location is great, the room is lovely :) only tricky part for me was getting up all the stairs with my suitcase but only because I’m 5 months pregnant! Also, I didn’t realise that weed is legal in NY, and there was a strong smell of it in part of the apartment which made me a bit worried being preggers. More a heads up for anyone visiting NYC! I loved the access system of getting into the stay, it felt really safe! Having air con was a huge help too!",5
"This is an awesome place if you’re in town to catch a Broadway play or just stroll around Manhattan. Everything’s close by and the place is nested in the middle of all the action - Broadway, restaurants, Times Square. Would definitely recommend!",5
Very close to Time Square; just a 10mins walk. Also all the broadway are just around the corner. Additionally multiple restaurants around. Host is responsive and had provided clear instructions. Will definitely come back again.,5
Adrian’s place was great for my needs. My room was clean and the property as a whole was quiet. The property was indeed cozy but I did not mind as it was close to plenty to do and within walking distance of Penn Station.,5
"The space was exactly as I expected given the reviews I read ahead of time. The location is great, and for a single person the bedroom had plenty of space and was very comfortable. The downsides were the street noise at night (I brought some ear plugs which were a little helpful, but I already knew to expect this and as another review mentioned, it dies down after a while). Overall I can't complain for the price and location. Adrian was also responsive and friendly. Would definitely stay again.",5
"Jeffrey was a fantastic host. He provided instructions before we arrived and was an incredible resource for information about the city during our stay. Our room was clean and private and extremely comfortable, and Jeffrey was very attentive to providing any additional items that we needed to make our stay more comfortable. And he was a fun, engaging and entertaining host. I would highly recommend Jeffrey. He and his place are top-notch.",5
"I stayed a week with my brother at Jeffery’s place, and it was the best. In the beginning, I was really scared about staying at an Airbnb since it was my first time. But, Jeffery was really kind to help and guide us with everything. The bed was SOOO soft it was so hard for me to get up at times 🤣 Anyways, Jeffery really felt like having a chill dad who would check in on us once in a while. He also gossiped with me every night (I always looked forward to that part of the night). If I could go back right now to stay for another week, I would. Thank you Jeffery!",5
"Our stay with Jeffery was well spent! My boyfriend and I don’t have a negative thing to say. Jeffery was extremely kind and responsive even before we checked in. The place was clean with all the amenities we needed for a 4-night stay. The location was also great for us as we used the subway, which had a stop only a couple blocks away, and drove as we could easily get on the FDR/Westside highway. Another highlight for us was that though it was a shared space, we felt welcomed, comfortable, and that we were granted our privacy throughout our stay. Highly recommend this place for single or double travelers! Thanks again Jeffery!",5
"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ I had an amazing time during my stay with Jeffrey! He was incredibly kind, thoughtful, and helpful throughout my visit. As an introverted person, I really appreciated how respectful he was of my space. I always felt comfortable and at ease. At the same time, he was always happy to offer great advice or have a meaningful chat about life. He is also very knowledgeable regarding the public transport in the city, and as somebody coming from a small town in England, I found this very helpful! I would 100% stay with Jeffrey again and could not recommend him more highly!",5
"Loved our stay with Jeffrey! He is kind, responsive, and extremely helpful. When it came to navigating NYC public transport from JFK to his place, he was crystal clear with instructions which is such a relief. Jeffrey does a great job of having lovely conversations with you when you want them and respecting your privacy, always. We were a chatty couple so we got to debrief our days with him (and hear about his days) every day of the trip. His apartment is beautiful and has so much character. He even surprised us with a cherry cake he had made and offered us a piece! So yummy.",5
"Jeffery was very accommodating from the start. We messaged him late the night before about booking, and he was able to accommodate. Our plane landed at 8am, so Jeffery met us to take our luggage back while we explored the city. Everything was clean, and Jeffery was always polite and super friendly whenever we crossed paths. If you’re looking to visit NYC and still get good sleep without the noise, this apartment was perfect. Jeffery was very welcoming and let you come and go at any hour without bothering but there if you needed anything.",5
"Jeffrey was one of the best hosts I’ve ever had on Airbnb. I very much enjoyed our chats about Theatre, which we both work in. When I needed laundry done, he very kindly did it. He kept all areas of the accommodation very tidy. I especially enjoyed his piano playing (divine) and his bathtub! I have a sensitivity to scented laundry detergent and he was responsive to my request to change the sheets. The one drawback was there wasn’t a proper table to sit down and eat my meals and work. He converts his living/dining room into his bedroom when guests stay, so the dining table wasn’t available. I adapted one of the small side tables in the bedroom to function as an eating area, so there is that option, along with a luggage rack with a removable countertop, which was too low for me. Otherwise, I had a great stay.",5
"We had a wonderful stay — thank you, Jeffrey! It was our first time in New York, and we absolutely loved it. We’ll definitely be back and highly recommend this place to everyone!",5
"Jeffrey was very responsive and seemed to be a great host. But, we were not aware that this would be a shared space. It should be very clear for future guests moving forward. Nonetheless, Jeffrey was very nice and had a great apartment.",3
"We had a wonderful stay at Jeffrey’s place. He was incredibly kind and went out of his way to make sure everything was comfortable during my time there. The apartment was spotless, and the neighborhood felt very safe. I also really appreciated how close it was to the station , just a short walk away, which made getting around super easy. Highly recommend!",5
Jeffrey was an excellent host. We changed our check in time and he was flexible and accommodating. His space was exactly as described and was spotless and comfortable. The location is perfect. It’s close to public transport and very easy to catch a cab from his block. It’s easy to walk to parks from the location and you can be at all the major tourist attractions within 20-30 minutes. We highly recommend Jeffrey and his space.,5
"10 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · May 2025 Jeffrey’s place was a super find for us, not only for its location and tasteful decor but the superb quality of Jeffrey as a host. He was informative and very helpful, yet very much gave us our space to enjoy as a home away from home. Travel to and from the apartment on upper west side was very easy to do via the Subway. Highly recommend Jeffrey and his place for a New York getaway!",5
"My mother and I had a great stay at Jeffrey's place! He is an extremely responsive, helpful, intelligent, and friendly host! He is also a colleague musician - we enjoyed very much conversing with him on various topics, and he was very kind to let me play on his piano. Jeffrey's place has our highest recommendations: it is very clean, has all necessary amenities, and the room is very comfortable, quiet, and easily hosts 2 people. The area is quite nice - conveniently close to the subway, in a good neighborhood, and with good restaurant choices and shopping locations. The apartment has everything that one might need; there is also an elevator in the hallway. My mother is extremely picky when it comes to travelling, and Jeffrey's place ticks all the boxes for her - which is why, in fact, this was a repeat visit for us (the last one of 5!). This is a great value for the price - and we couldn't recommend it more strongly for anyone visiting or looking to do business in NY!",5
"Such a lovely stay! I appreciated the care & thought in all of the details at Jeffrey’s. All was as pictured & very clean. I really enjoyed Jeffrey’s warmth & hospitality, I looked forward to chatting about music when our paths crossed. Recommend most highly!",5
"Jeff was a super responsive and helpful host who was always available. The apartment itself was great. Only note is that the listing shows a living room with a piano, etc. This room was not accessible to us as guests and it was where Jeff stayed while we were in the only bedroom. He has a curtain separating the room from shared spaces, but that’s it. This was somewhat of a disappointment as the listing did not explicitly state that this area would not be accessible. It might be good to clarify that in the listing.",4
Jeffrey is an amazing host. Me and my girlfriend felt like home. He was very welcoming and very friendly. I really enjoyed the stories and some information he shared with us about NY. He was always quick to respond. Definitely made our NY experience at least 10 times better.,5
"The location, just blocks from the 96th Street Subway station, made exploring the city a breeze. Mornings began on a high note with complimentary coffee, getting my day off to a good start. One afternoon, the host baked a batch of lemon shortbread cookies and generously shared them—a nice and unexpected treat. A neatly prepared handout offered helpful tips on nearby grocery stores and restaurants, making settling in effortless. With ample closet and drawer space, and accommodations that were both impeccably clean and inviting, the stay felt very welcoming.",5
"Jeffrey was the best host ever. Staying at his place in the Upper West Side was the highlight of my entire trip. He’s not only incredibly welcoming, but genuinely a joy to spend time with—you immediately feel at home. The apartment itself is so charming and peaceful, with the most comfortable bed I’ve ever slept in. The location couldn’t be better—right next to the subway, with lots of great spots for coffee and food nearby, including Trader Joe’s. I can’t recommend staying with Jeffrey enough. If you get the chance, go for it—you’ll love every minute.",5
"We had the pleasure of staying at Jeffrey’s, and our experience was absolutely wonderful. From the moment we arrived, Jeffrey made us feel right at home with his warm hospitality and thoughtful touches. The space was clean, cozy, and well-equipped with everything we needed for a comfortable stay. The location was ideal, and the amenities exceeded our expectations. Jeffrey was always available to assist with any questions, ensuring everything went smoothly throughout our stay. We couldn’t have asked for a better host. Highly recommend!",5
"Great place to stay! It is in a great location with many food and drink options around it, super close to Central Park and the subway. I have stayed at this location before, and hopefully, in the future, when another New York trip comes along, if it's available, this is my first choice.",5
Jeffrey is a great host. His place was perfect for me as it was close to my son's home where I visited my new grand-daughter. He was helpful with stores and bus inexpensive bus nearby to travel to LGA for departing flight. I would definitely stay again.,5
"Perfect neighborhood, safe and quiet at all hours, easy subway access. Terrific value, particularly for those like us there for Lincoln Center performances. On the small side for two people, but that’s New York. Great, responsive host. Excellent Airbnb experience.",5
"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ A peaceful stay with a thoughtful host I stayed with Jeffrey for a few days while exploring New York, and it was a grounding and peaceful experience. The apartment is well-located, quiet, and clean — perfect for someone who enjoys their own space and a reflective atmosphere. Jeffrey was kind and respectful throughout the stay, and I appreciated the subtle balance between privacy and presence. We had a few heartfelt conversations that reminded me of the beauty of real connection, even in the middle of a busy city. Thank you for holding a space that feels calm in contrast to the noise of the world. Would recommend for solo travelers looking to slow down and be present.",5
"Jeffrey is a great host and let us store our bags at the AirBnb before check in! He's responsive and reliable and a great communicator. He was super friendly, checked in on us, and was flexible! He also gave us lots of great recs!",5
"Amazing stay! The place was extremely clean, comfortable, and exactly as described. The host was super friendly, welcoming, and truly amazing they made the whole experience even better. The location in Sunnyside is perfect, with so many great restaurants nearby and a huge variety of food options to choose from. It’s a great area to be in and very convenient. I would absolutely stay here again and highly recommend it! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",5
"We had a wonderful stay at Daniela’s apartment. The location is very convenient, with easy access to both the subway and buses.

Since it was Christmas time, the decorations added a lovely festive touch. We would definitely recommend staying here!",5
"2 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · December 2025 I loved my stay at Daniela's place. It was very convenient for bus and train rides into the City- quiet at night.

"Highly recommend Daniela’s place! Great location, stores and food options just a few minutes by foot and then manhattan is only 20 mins on the subway with the closest station being a 3 min walk from the apartment. The room was warm, cozy and clean! Thank you",5
"We really enjoyed our stay and will be back! Clean, easy check in and the location was a short 5 min walk to the subway and a 15-20min ride in to the city. Great breakfast spots nearby as well. Very friendly host who happily gave us tips on things to see and places to eat. Our flight was really early and we were able to put our bags in the apartment before check in. Great little place!",5
"Very happy with my stay at Daniela’s!! The building was charming and I felt like I was getting an authentic NYC experience. The train being a five minute walk, it was easy and cheap to explore several parts of the city. Although it was freezing outside when we visited, the apartment was a warm and cozy oasis. We had everything we needed and more and I felt right at home :) my partner was worried about staying in a shared space, but we didn’t even see the other guests and they were respectful of the space. We did meet Daniela, who is absolutely lovely. I would definitely stay here again and I recommend it to anyone!",5
So glad we stayed here. Daniela was very responsive and made sure we felt comfortable and welcome. The area is very safe and was very close to the train station making it easy to get places quickly. Loved it!,5
Daniela gave good accurate and detailed instructions. We found everything immediately and the place was as described. The metro was very close to the apartment. The price was a bit high.,4

Great location! 5 minute walk to the subway. The room and space were very clean. Would definitely stay again.,5
"We stayed in Daniela’s rental in Sunnyside, Queens for a week and it was one of the best experiences with Airbnb we have ever had. We appreciated the hospitality of the host who was above and beyond with cleanliness and organization in the apartment. The bed was very comfortable, there were lots of storage places and the kitchen was well stocked. The instructions were clearly communicated to us. Furthermore, the host was always prompt in answering questions or concerns. The Flushing 7 line was a 5 minute walk and the neighborhood had all essential amenities. We felt it was good value for money!",5
"Such a great stay in New York! It was our first time in the city and the place was totally what we were looking for. The location is right next to the subway but is very calm and clean at the same time. The neigbourhood seemed to be very safe. The room was clean, nice designed and really comfortable for two.

Zen like bedroom oasis less than two blocks from Wicked theatre. Our third girls trip for broadway week each January and we'll only stay with Niko. He's the greatest host and we love the space and the neighborhood. We ate at a wonderful bagel place and the French restaurant across the street at Niko's suggestion. It's so wonderful to have a host who knows all the best places in the city. We are already planning our next stay at Niko's.,5
"8 months on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · January 2026 We had such a happy time every single day. We were able to relax very comfortably and finish our trip feeling truly happy. Niko was incredibly kind and considerate, taking great care of us until the very end, so we didn’t feel uncomfortable even once. Since New York is quite expensive, being able to cook inside really helped us save money as well. Thank you so much, and we sincerely hope to meet again on another occasion.",5
"Niko is a wonderful host. He’s friendly, welcoming, thoughtful, and accommodating. The apartment is very comfortable. This is a great location. Strongly recommend the Dominican restaurant with the green awning on his block but closer to 10 Ave. It’s a hole in the wall with excellent authentic Dominican food at great prices. Indian place on 9 between 51 and 52 also excellent and affordable.",5
"Niko is a fantastic host. Warm and friendly, very communicative and responsive. Place was clean and as described, was just what I needed for a place to stay on business travel. Recommend the area as well, right in the heart of hells kitchen and lots of great restaurants within minutes in all directions. Easy to get to, feels secure and the area is safe.",5

Close to the subway, close to the theater district, and many amazing restaurants in Hell's Kitchen. Just a super visit! Thank you, Niko!",5
"Niko was such a fantastic host, one of the best I've ever stayed with in my decade+ of using AirBnB. He's incredibly responsive, proactive, and just a great soul.

Highly recommend staying with Niko. be sure to say hi to his adorable guinea pigs! 👋",5
"Niko is an amazing person, communicative and always worried about everything. The place in general is small, but the room is perfect, good size for one or two.

The apartment is in a perfect location in Hell’s Kitchen within short walking distance of many restaurants, bars, theaters, and subway stations.

We also enjoyed meeting Niko’s guinea pigs Midnight and Munchkin! Would definitely stay again!",5

"Niko was an amazing host! he was so accommodating to everything and he’s just a hoot overall.

I had the time of my life in NYC and Niko’s airbnb was just perfect. Can’t wait to come back here.,5
It's a perfect place to visit NYC for several days. Location is convenient to everywhere. The host is super enthusiastic. The room is lovely.,5
"The listing and location were great. The bedroom was comfortable, and the shared spaces were clean. It's conveniently located near the subway and restaurants, plus many tourist attractions. However, my experience with the host was unsettling. The first two nights were fine, but on the third day, he repeatedly asked about my checkout time. On my last day, he barged into my room at 7:45 am, terrifying me; I had to block the door with a chair. He seemed surprised when I reminded him it was not even 8am yet. He only apologized after I expressed my discomfort. He offered a Paris baguette bag, but it was filled with trash. He mentioned partying one of the nights I was there. On check-in day, he offered early access but ignored my calls until he finally woke up and gave me a one day rebate, which I appreciated. Disregarding the check-in mishap, I'm shocked by this experience given his prior ratings. I wouldn’t recommend this place for those valuing safety and privacy.",2

"Niko’s place provided us a very comfortable, beautifully decorated and private space in his apartment. Our 3-night stay could not have been better and met our every expectation, aligning with the descriptions provided. Niko is a kind and thoughtful host who was readily available to answer our questions and provide great recommendations but otherwise completely respected our space and independence during our stay. This felt so comfortable for us. And of course, the location is unbeatable for walkability and transit to so many of New York’s top sites. Niko’s place played a big role in the fantastic time we had in NYC.",5
"Niko was a fabulous host. Super responsive, kind, and would check in periodically to make sure things were okay!

"Returning guests who love the place and the host. Niko welcomed us back as if we were old friends. Everything is so comfortable: the bed, the pillows, the lighting. We slept so well after a day of Chinatown, Little Italy and MJ the musical. We were well rested for our 2nd day which was 2 more plays and a 50th year SNL experience. We had a metro card but barely used it. Everything was so close. We are coming back as soon as we can!",5

It is comfortable, clean, and thoughtfully laid out given the small space.",5

The location was perfect for our trip and felt very safe. So close to the tourist destinations, tons of restaurants, the train station, and the subway. If I’m back in NYC, I’ll definitely book again!",5
"12 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · May 2024 We had an enjoyable stay with Niko. we spent much of the day out and about and he's in a very convenient location. Please be advised, there is no lift to get up so this accommodation wouldn't be ideal if you had big heavy bags or more accessible accommodation. For us, this was fine and Niko was friendly each day.",5
"8 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · February 2024 If you are looking for for a home in NY, Please don’t hesitate to stay here. This place is just one- two blocks from everywhere. Nico tried his best to make us feel home. He is very considerable and kind. He provides good hospitality which is very impressive and important to us. I’ve been to NY a few times so I have my priorities to choose where to stay and Nico’s place was perfect for me. Thank you Niko",5
"3 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · August 2025 This place helped me enjoy New York perfectly during my week-long stay. A good location and a pleasant environment are really important points in a trip to New York, and I think it's a place that solves everything. The huge cost of accommodation in New York is the biggest obstacle, but thanks to you, I was able to resolve it well and return:) Translated from Korean Show original",5
"10 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · May 2025 The location is so good because it's near Central Park, but the smell of guinea pigs was so bad that it was hard to get into the house. Fortunately, the room I stayed in didn't smell like guinea pigs. There is no elevator, so it is very difficult for people with a lot of luggage. The stairs are steep. Translated from Korean Show original",5
"Great experience! Ask for Richie at the bar. He gave us so many great recommendations. The room is very small; as with any thing in NYC, but furnished perfectly with everything you need! My only complaint is their elevators…take forever to get one bc there’s only 4 and they run slow. Keep that in mind if you’re on a schedule. I would definitely stay again! Great location!",5
Great spot and as advertised. Clean and very friendly staff. Room is a bit “cozy” but that’s to be expected in Manhattan. Same for the price being a bit steep but really a fairly good deal relative to other options close by during the holidays. It’s close to Times Square so expect some noise. Get a higher floor if possible to help with that. Definitely would stay here again. Heath,5
"Loved this place, will definitely be back. Location is central so easy to walk everywhere. The room was cozy and very clean. It was not tacky, or uncomfortable. It was really nice.",5
"My daughter and I spent several days here to celebrate her 21st birthday. The room was small but comfy with a great view. Every staff member we encountered went out of their way to be helpful and friendly. Having a restaurant in the hotel was a plus, and the views from the rooftop bar were amazing!",5
Second time staying at this resort and it won’t be my last. It’s located just center from everything one is interested to see in NY. There’s a train station entrance right by the hotel to get you going on your way. The staff is very helpful and friendly!,5
Front desk check in & check out crews were always helpful and polite. Valentina was very kind and efficient in getting us the appropriate room. There were issues with the elevator taking a very long time throughout the stay- she provided excellent customer service and we were taken care of.,5
"I found it quite expensive for a tiny room, even for New York. Scaffolding over the front door, waiting area for elevator small, cramped, and crowded at times. Otherwise, the room was clean, convenient and quiet, which was most important.",4
Very good experience (overall). Only downside was they told us where to park but did not explain that we should pay for parking at checkout to receive a $10.00 discount/validation. I guess I missed that on the website.,4
"We had an amazing time in NYC as the Margaritaville resort was exactly as described. A great location in the heart of Times Square with access to the subway right across the street. It was really fun to have a drink at the rooftop with NYC happening down below, we were extremely close to everything we wanted to do with easy access. The hosts were amazing and very responsive as we did have some confusion with the parking lot associated with the hotel initially but the hosts got it figured out for us. We will 100 percent be back when we come back to NYC and can’t wait to return. Thanks for a great stay!",5
"I’ve stayed in many air bnbs and this one here has been my absolute favorite. I enjoyed everything. There is truly nothing bad I could say. Elevators had long lines but that just lets me know foods good, drinks are even better and I can’t wait to go back.",5
Great stay! Ex-New Yorker back in town for a wedding and this hotel was an incredible deal!! Great and big (for NYC) rooms that were spotless and very well done. Staff were incredibly helpful. Doorman and security lat at night were great. We would definitely come back!,5
"Our stay was fantastic! The host was wonderful & The location in Times Square couldn’t be more perfect — close to the subway, restaurants, and so many attractions. The room was clean, comfortable, and just as described. The pool was amazing! The staff were friendly and welcoming, which made the whole experience even better. Communication with the host was smooth and easy, and check-in was a breeze. I would absolutely stay here again and recommend it to anyone visiting NYC!",5
"Great location, super clean and friendly staff. Definitely a great place to call home while exploring the city!",5
"Came for a broadway show, perfect hotel for that area. Clean and cozy with a great price.",5
"We had a wedding in the city and instead of using a traditional booking method we tried through Airbnb. I was a little hesitant because it was my first time booking a hotel through Airbnb, but I am happily surprised of how easy it was and a bit cheaper as well. The hotel was in the heart of Times Square so the location was perfect for everywhere we needed to go. Everyone who worked there was very kind and friendly. The room was pretty spacious for an NYC room. I was excited to use the all year round pool, but unfortunately, there was a event that weekend and it snowed so it was too icy the following day but totally understandable and didn’t ruin the trip at all. If we didn’t have the wedding, we wouldn’t have left hotel because there was just so much to do within it. Bars, restaurants, by the way totally check out the rooftop bar! Communication was easy and we would definitely stay here again!!",5
The staff was very friendly and helpful. There is so much to do in this area and it was easy to get to.,5
"Amazing staff and service. Great location, lots of action but yet the hotel was quiet, away from traffic.",5
Fantastic views and an amazing location if you’re in town for a Broadway play like we were. Staff were great and the Margaritaville Resort alone had 4-5 places to eat.,5
"Clean room, right in the middle of everything, very walkable to theaters, bars, restaurants, public transportation right outside the door. Starbucks 1 block away.",5
"We stayed at Margaritaville Times Square for a week while celebrating my birthday, and it turned out to be the perfect choice. The location is unbeatable—right in the heart of the city with easy access to public transportation. Check-in was quick and hassle-free, and our room was spotless, cozy, and welcoming. The highlight was the stunning view from our room, especially at night when the city lights came alive. We also loved the rooftop bar—great drinks and an absolutely breathtaking view of the skyline. I highly recommend Margaritaville Times Square to anyone visiting New York City. When we return, we’ll definitely be staying here again!",5
"My husband and I had an amazing time at Margaritaville Resort! Karlo was so helpful at the front desk, and even gave us a call when our room was ready for check-in. Our luggage drop was a breeze, and the room was even better than we imagined. We had a city view from our 14th-floor room, and it was super clean and tidy. Plus, it’s right in the heart of everything. We highly recommend this place!",5
Margaritaville resort in Time Square was perfect. They gave me a room 3 hours earlier than the normal check in time. The staff all were very professional. The resort was also in a great location with plenty of restaurants and things to do in walking distance. Parking was right across the street. Definitely will be returning soon,5
"Loved staying here, walking distance to everything in Times Square and easiest access to the subway from any direction. Great restaurants and a lot to do. Would recommend Margaritaville to Air BnB guests and hotels guests. The staff were so friendly and super helpful with any questions we had. Easy check in and check out. Loved everything about our stay!!!!",5
"I wouldn't generally choose to stay in Times Square (though it's certainly convenient if you've never been to New York and want the experience). But I saw a deal for this room on Airbnb and it was fantastic. Very clean and quiet room, comfortable bed, and a Jimmy Buffet theme throughout the entire place. Slow elevator service was the only downside. Otherwise I had a great stay.",5
I had an absolutely fabulous stay at this listing! It was a beautiful and clean room located in a wonderful hotel! The location is perfect- in Times Square but just outside the main hustle and bustle to where it isn’t super loud and crowded. My favorite part was the rooftop bar/restaurant with amazing views of the city! Highly recommend and will be staying here again!,5
"The room was cozy, but the view was absolutely stunning! It was spotlessly clean, and I especially loved how the sunlight poured in, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere each morning. The bed was comfortable, and the amenities were well-maintained. The staff was friendly and attentive, making my stay even more enjoyable. Overall, a great experience, and I would definitely stay here again!",5
"Brunswick, Maryland Rating, 5 stars , · March 2025 I loved the location. Room was small, but the decorations were really cute and made you feel at home. The bed is super comfortable. Probably one of the more comfortable beds I’ve ever slept on while traveling. It’s right in the heart of Times Square and also offers full time security staff so you feel safe at all times. Will definitely book here again next time",5
We had a great stay at Margaritaville! It is right in the middle of the hustle and bustle of Times Square with easy access to the train. The rooms were beautiful and felt brand new. Check in took three minutes and they even managed to give us an upgraded corner room which we very much appreciated! Would absolutely stay here again!,5
Great location right in heart of Time Square. Housekeeping did amazing the whole time we were there.,5
We had an amazing time and had absolutely no issues! Everybody was nice and communication was great! We would book there again!,5
"Location was perfect!! Anytime I come back to New York, this is where I’ll be staying.",5
This is in an excellent location. Close to everything you would want to do. The hotel staff are great. Rooftop bar is fun with great views. Easy access to subway.,5
"Wonderful staff, friendly, accommodating to our needs, clean rooms, just like the pictures, it was overall a great stay. Thank you staff and management",5
"We arrived at the Margaritaville Resort in Times Square around 7:30pm. We were able to find the front desk no issue. The employees at the resort were incredibly kind. Despite the hosts Jason and Lizzy confirming our reservation a few days earlier, saying they were “excited for our stay”, the hotel had no record of our reservation. They checked under every name. We attempted to contact the hosts to see if it was under a name or if they could help resolve this. We did not hear from them at all and were left with no place to stay in the city since the resort was sold out. Thankfully Airbnb was able to refund us and we were able to sleep a few blocks down at another hotel. The employees at the resort were more than accommodating and I would gladly book a stay at the resort in the future. However I will never be booking hotel stays through Airbnb again. Thanks for nothing Jason and Lizzy.",1
"For a quick little getaway in the city, this was perfect! The hotel staff were nothing short of accomadating. I was not able to check in early but concierge held onto my bags until our room was ready and for a few hours after I checked out. No wrong choices for drinks either!",5
"I'm so glad I chose to stay at this hotel! My room was incredibly spacious with a stunning view of the Manhattan skyline. Everything was spotless, and the atmosphere made it easy to relax and unwind. Room service was consistently prompt and attentive, every call was answered right away. I also appreciated the complimentary bottled water throughout my stay; it was a thoughtful touch. The hotel's location right in the heart of Times Square and within short distances to anywhere you'd want to visit in Manhattan. Highly recommended",5
"Location was amazing. Clean room and good amenities. Because the elevators are open to the public to get to the two restaurants and the rooftop bar, elevator wait times were tough sometimes. Otherwise great stay",5
"Excellent location if you’re in tourist mode, very central location close to Times Square. Pool came in handy as it was 30+ and the room was very new/modern and clean. Maybe the only issue was the wait time for the elevators but other than that I enjoyed my stay.",5
"We looked at a lot of different hotels and decided on Margaritaville due to location and reputation. It was fantastic! The rooms were cute and spotless. We had a great view of the pool and city. We had a Keurig coffee maker in our in room and the rooftop bar had amazing drinks, food and view! All of the staff were so friendly and very proactive in letting us know when our room was ready for check in. Would definitely stay again. Also, it’s helpful to bring a sound machine due for those of us not used to “the big city”! 😉",5
"Nice hotel with pool and rooms a little more bigger than common rooms in nyc. Very clean. Excellent hotel. If I had to point out something to improve, it would be the food options.",5
"My boyfriend and I had tickets to a play and decided in the city overnight. We started our search on Airbnb and I’m so glad we did. . We found Margaritaville and couldn’t be happier with everything about our stay. Check in was easy (and in fact we arrived early and were able to get into our room early), hotel staff couldn’t have been nicer, the room was small but absolutely adorable and very clean, and we had a great view. Great experience and I can’t wait to come back.",5
Exactly as described. Parking was less than a block away and was affordable only 35 dollars per night in a secured parking garage. Everything was within walking distance from the hotel or had public transportation easily accessible.,5
Very friendly and clean. Definitely be back!,5
Everything was great. Perfect spot to stay if you are going to be in Times Square,5
Great stay near Times Square. Very nice rooms - Feels like being on a beach vacation!,5
"13 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · September 2025 Great staff and a fantastic location! Would recommend this to everyone.",5
very friendly people and cool view! the pool is nice and the restaurants stay separate in what you can order so it doesn’t feel like youre eating the same thing in a different location.,5
"We are so pleased with our stay. The staff was friendly and helpful. One night, specifically, we were trying to go to the Rooftop Bar, but the button on the elevator was being finicky. A staff member immediately assisted us. He was patient, diligent, and kind. We had incredibly busy days while in NYC. We left at 7:00 AM and often didn’t return until that evening. It was so nice to walk into a clean room each day. We never wanted for clean towels or clean sheets! They also provided fresh water and coffee each day. We felt right at home. We will be staying here again. I can’t say enough great things about this place, and the views are top tier! While I’m glad to be home, I will miss this place. Until next time! 🗽🍎🤍",5
"As first time visitors to NYC, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Margaritaville Times Square. Tons of day/night life very close by but just far enough away to still feel like a peaceful escape. Security on duty by the entrance made the stay feel very safe at all times, and they did not hesitate to turn non visitors away after closing hours. Staff members were very nice and accommodating with anything we needed, house keeping kept our room well stocked/clean and we especially appreciated the luggage storage accommodations before & after our check out. Zero complaints, would certainly stay here again.",5
Will be staying there every time I go to nyc now,5
"great location, quiet room, perfect to time square",5
Awesome location close to everything. also very clean,5
It was great.. recommend it for anyone!,5
Perfect Location! Would definitely book again!!,5
A great place to stay. Location was amazing and the room was quiet even though in Times Square. Bed was very comfortable,5
"My friend and I stayed here for a week and loved it. Super clean, the staff is very friendly, as well as others staying at the hotel. Great spot right in times square",5
Great place to stay for tourist as everything is accessible. Walkable distance to scenic spots. Room is clean. Will definitely come back to stay in this hotel.,5
Place was great right in the middle of everything. Room was clean staff were great. I’d stay again,5
"Great spot if your in the city for a broadway show. Clean, friendly staff, central location.",5
"Exactly what I was looking for in hotel! Perfect location next to broadway shows and time square. Tons of things to do near the resort. Also it was centrally located in the city to easily travel around to see the surroundings. Gorgeous roof top bar/restaurant with stunning views of the city that you don’t want to miss!Absolutely friendly and helpful staff! Housekeeping was the best, keeping us stocked with water/coffee and keeping our room immaculate!!! Only negative was the Margaritaville restaurant. Good food but very time consuming-hard to get in and hard to get food/drinks since they were busy and understaffed. Dinner on a Saturday at 4pm took 2 hrs for our meal (for 2 people) and we ended up just asking for our ticket and leaving after waiting 45 mins on our second round of drinks that never came. Still with all of this said, I would definitely stay again ♥️",5
Good location for being near Times Square. The hotel itself has good amenities as well. Would stay here again,5
Beautiful place lots to do. The only down is the parking situation but it is time square. Host was very responsive.,5
Would stay again!,5
N,5
overall good stay,5
"Easy check in, friendly front desk staff, and lots to do at the hotel. Would stay there again.",5
"Great location, clean, friendly staff and the rooftop bar was a plus.",4
"6 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · April 2025 Be aware that the city tax is not included and $300 holding fee is taken at the time of checkin",5
"Great location, helpful staff and very clean. Highly recommended",5
Very nice rooms for short weekend stay. Close to many things and many subway lines.,5
Excellent and flawless experience. Definitely a recommended place to stay if you are visiting manhattan,5
My stay was amazing !!!,5
All was great,5
Would stay here again. Clean and good atmosphere.,5
We had great stay. Staff were friendly and welcoming.,5
"This was such a clean,fun and relaxing hotel to stay at, the host is amazing.",5
"We were required to pay an additional $300 deposit, but never received it back.",3
great place especially if you are in New York for Broadway shows,4
Very clean room with nice view,5
My stay was exceptional. one the best rooms I ever stayed in new York city.,5
Great location in Times Square! Tons to do nearby.,5
"At the end of the day, it was a place to sleep. It is in the middle of the hustle and bustle of Times Square which was convenient for getting around to broadway shows. The cleanliness of the room was questionable considering there were hand prints on the windows. The front desk staff were very nice. Would I stay there again? Probably not but the experience was unforgettable. Thanks Margaritaville",3
"I Traveled To New York For Fashion Week Castings And AfterParties. This place is the one of the most beautiful places I have ever stayed everything detailed about this place is 100% beyond the truth it’s even better in person.I feel that me and this place have a new found relationship and I cannot wait to return.The host was very helpful with all the instructions before check in,this stay is 10/10 definitely would recommend.",5
"We loved the location. Service at the hotel was very good! The room was small, but comfortable. It would have been nice to have at least a desk chair with a back for a place to sit. The base of the bed caused many stubbed toes and shins. It would be nice if something could be done to prevent that! Overall it was great and we will be back!",5
"I had a great time at this Margaritaville. The location is amazing, the room was lovely, and the hotel overall is really nice, it was restaurants and Bars, including a rooftop with an amazing view. The staff is super friendly and welcoming, and always had a good attitude and willingness to help. I strongly recommend this hotel and I’d be back for sure.",5
"This location was in the center of it all. We walked everywhere - Times Square, Bryant park, NY public library, St Patrick’s cathedral, Rockefeller tree and more. Room was so clean and perfect. Huge windows overlooking the city street which was pretty cool. Heated pool you can see below. Will definitely be staying again.",5
"Host was very accommodating when i changed my stay date. I really enjoyed being close to many attractions and so much of it walkable. We walked to central park and the Empire State. I wish we had an opportunity to visit the roof top bar and pool but the pool was closed due to in-climate weather. Would stay again, thanks!",5
"This was my third time staying at the Margaritaville Resort Times Square. Rooms are exceptionally clean the decor is fun and beachy. Staff is exceptional! Elevators are a bit glitchy so you might have to wait, otherwise a great resort in a great location. *note if you are a light sleeper you will hear sirens and traffic from Times Square at night.",5
"Staying at Margaritaville Resort in Times Square was a blast! The tropical vibe was a refreshing escape right in the city, and the rooftop bar offered fantastic views with delicious cocktails—perfect after a day of sightseeing. The rooms were clean, stylish, and had a fun, island-inspired design. Perfect location, in the heart of the city, great atmosphere—highly recommend for a fun NYC experience.",5
"It’s unclear from the listing how heavily Jimmy Buffet themed the place is. The decor, music in the elevator, colors, etc are a bit much if you’re not expecting it. The location is in a super busy area but very quiet in the rooms. The rooms are small but well furnished and very clean. It’s crazy expensive for what you get but seems to be on par with nyc hotels.",4
"Great location in Times Square, and clean rooms. Only note is the “self parking” option is not self parking in a traditional, it is still valet parking but without the option of getting your car in and out throughout the day. That was confusing for us. Besides that though, staff was friendly and having multiple bars/restaurants on site is a great touch for the resort feel downtown NYC.",5
"We had a wonderful time here. It was great to have everything in one spot - food, drinks, pool, etc. We were able to walk everywhere. The only issue was the elevator. There are not enough elevators and that became frustrating around popular times. Other than that, this was great. Highly recommend for a weekend away.",4
We absolutely loved the location. Right in the heart of Times Square! First time visiting New York and we really enjoyed ourselves. Can't wait to plan our next trip. We're thinking that Margaritaville Resort be our go-to whenever we visit. Thank you for showing us such great hospitality! Most definitely a 10/10!,5
"8 years on Airbnb Rating, 3 stars , · July 2024 Had a great stay at Margaritaville! It’s central and walking distance to everything! The only downfall we had was the elevators. They only had 3 elevators working for the entire hotel, be prepared to wait 15 + mins to get on one especially during the peak hours! Make sure to allocate time for the elevators if you’re planning on going somewhere because we were almost late to our reservations we had. The elevators were an absolute nightmare here",3
"The staff were really friendly and helpful. The bedroom was really clean and the bed comfortable. The lifts took a long time to arrive and did not seem up to the task of the number of people they had to carry. The menus could be more interesting, The hotel is in an ideal location for exploring New York, we had an enjoyable three days there.",4
Clean and amazing views I loved it thank you,5
"Place was better than expected, highly recommend.",5
Staycation was great ! Good views good food and margaritas!,5
Everyone was helpful and great location,5
"Great stay, had amazing time! We would go again!",5
Amazing stay! Would 100% come back,5
Such a beautiful location. We arrived two hours early and our room was already ready. They provided us with plenty of free bottled water. For such a big hotel our room was always cleaned and serviced and the elevators were quick. We felt right at home. Would definitely stay again.,5
"We had such a great time! Check in was easy, everything was walking distance. Time Square was less than a 10 min walk, and there was so much entertainment around the resort. The view from our room was phenomenal! I will definitely book again, with these amazing host !",5
"This past weekend was my fiancé‘s birthday, challenge arose, trying to keep the trip a surprise. I can honestly say that she was completely surprised, and excited to do the things that this wonderful city offered we took in a Broadway show, explored Midtown, and downtown Manhattan. Ultimately the trip was perfect for the occasion. Thank you so much. I wouldn’t have been able to pull this off without you guys.",5
"Honestly it does not get more New York than this. It was a lovely time with Trenton. He was super responsive, geniunely the most accommodating guy and overall a kind person I had the pleasure of getting to know. I’m not a fan of the neighborhood but it was such a great stay I’d do it again, especially because it’s so reasonably priced and so convenient to everything. Love the man. Wishing him the best of luck and hop yall enjoy ur stay with him too!",5
"9 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · January 2026 Had a great stay with Trenton and definitely recommend for anyone with a budget-friendly alternative to nearby hotels. Will be returning myself. Very clear communication, friendly, responsive, and helpful. Thanks Trenton!",5
This was the best stay I’ve ever had. I enjoyed myself and had the best guides to help. Trenton’s parents made my trip in New York even better and Trenton himself was a great host. I appreciate you guys and thank you. Everything was very good for my first trip.,5
"I had a wonderful stay! The room was clean, comfortable, and exactly as described. Trenton was an amazing host. Super friendly, responsive, and made sure I had everything I needed. Highly recommend staying here!",5
"Trenton was a great host, he was nice and always made sure i didn’t need anything. The room and the bathroom were clean, the bedsheets ans towel too. The neighborhood gets sketchy though, especially if you’re a solo traveler (even more as a woman), thankfully nothing happened to me, but i was cautious. The subway is indeed really close to the place and it takes u to manhattan in less than 20 min. To sum up, the place is really practical if you’re planning on visiting nyc, just be aware at night.",5
"On my 3-day trip to New York, I stayed at Trenton's house. The house was located in Harlem, very close to the subway. I didn't have any transportation problems. It's on the 6th floor of a building without an elevator, but that wasn't a problem for me. Trenton was a good host. This house was a perfect price performance accommodation for me. I highly recommend ☺️ (note: those who are very sensitive to sound may be a little disturbed because the train passes very close but it is not a big problem)",5
Could not ask for a better place to stay for a quick trip! Great location for anywhere you want to enjoy in the city. Trenton was so responsive and welcoming! I would highly recommend.,5
"Trenton might be one of the coolest guys I’ve ever met. His place really makes you feel like a true New Yorker, not just another tourist. Everything’s cozy and has that local vibe. If you’re traveling solo, this is definitely your spot.",5
"Trenton is warm and welcoming, let me drop my bag off an hour early, and talked to me like an actual person instead of a customer or something. great guy and great spot, ill be staying here again in the future!",5
"Trenton is a great communicative, helpful host. The stay was perfect for my purposes to crash for a night after a work event and work day. It is very accessible to subway lines and to nearby restaurants and the Hudson River Greenway. For those looking for an affordable stay for a brief trip into Manhattan, this is a great option to consider",5
"Honestly: I didn’t expect much when booking. But the room is a bit bigger and more comfy than it seems in the pictures. Also the neighbourhood is alright, had no problems walking alone at night (although some company would have made me feel safer, but that’s a me thing). What made me very happy to have booked there was how friendly and helpful Trenton was. I don’t think you‘ll find a better AirBnB for this price range. Would come again.",5
"I had a great time at Trenton's place. Everything was as described in the listing. Overall it is a good value for the price, and a great place to crash after a long day visiting New-York. Trenton was very helpful as well. The place is very well located, with multiple subway lines that go downtown. Also I didn't have any issues walking around the neighborhood, even alone after 10pm.",5
"Trenton was a wonderful host! He was helpful, flexible and responsive. The room was basic and was in an urban setting. The area had typical NYC noises, it’s not a quiet neighborhood. And It’s not the Ritz-Carleton, but it’s an affordable night stay in NYC. Public transportation is very close and It’s an easy bus ride to LGA.",5
"I had a great stay at Trenton’s place! The apartment was very clean, quiet, and comfortable — a rare find in Manhattan. It was an incredible value for the location, and Trenton was kind and helpful throughout my stay. I would absolutely recommend his place to anyone looking for an affordable and pleasant stay in NYC.",5
"Trenton is a great (great) host, kind and accomodating 🫶 He gave me amazing recommendations for nearby places. To all my dear French, this is a good listing to spend sleeping and exploring New York during the day; for cheap in Manhattan, so close to everything! 🗽 Regarding the neighborhood, mind your own business and it should be okay Translated from English Show original",5
"Trenton is an amazing host! He’s super friendly, gave very clear instructions on how to use the keys, etc. he also shared a code for food delivery which was delicious and a huge money saver! He also let me leave mu suitcase after checkout, as I had a late evening flight. The place is close to subway and only 20 minutes to manhattan. Would definitely recommend Trenton and his place!",5
"Trenton is very friendly. I felt guilty that I didn’t get the chance to have a proper conversation. Until the last hour where Trenton kindly let me check out late while I waited for my Lyft. This place does exactly what it says on the tin! If you want High Society living in New York, Harlem is not the place. This is a real neighbourhood though and as long as you keep your head down it is perfectly safe. Trenton’s place is perfect for a single traveller looking for a cheap stay and just wants a bed and bathroom. Very responsive and helpful on check-in. I think it was almost 1am by the time I arrived and I was shattered. He was perfectly happy for me to go straight to my room, even helping with my luggage! I think I am done with New York, this was my 3rd visit. But if I do I would definitely look to book Trenton again! Thanks for your hospitality 👍🏻",5
"Trenton was a great host. He was very helpful and communicative, and was able to accommodate to my plans. Would stay again",5
Trenton was a great host. He was flexible and proactive with excellent communication and was also friendly. Everything was as described and I had a comfortable stay. I’d definitely return in the future.,5
"Trenton’s place was perfect for my solo NYC trip! Great host, gave a few suggestions but otherwise left me to my own devices. Very responsive on messages and great location for the subway stop",5
"Trenton is a great host. Easy to talk to and super communicative. Place is exactly as shown in the photos. It’s a decent walk to the subway line. Lots of great Harlem restaurants and deli’s close by. Noise may be an issue for you as there is a train line close to the place, but I managed to sleep through it fine. The room was very comfortable. All in all, I would stay here again. You’ll need to commute a little to get to Midtown, but it’s still a nice option.",5
"If you are a solo traveller, Trenton's space is an affordable and comfortable choice. Close to the subway, so transportation is seamless. Trenton is a good host and access to and from the building is easy.",5
Great stay for a few days in the City. Super easy to get to from LGA. Subway was close. Quite street. Very comfortable room. Trenton was very helpful and friendly. Will look to stay here again!!,5
"Great place for the price, felt like crashing at a friend's place for a couple nights. Trenton was great about checking in to make sure I was comfortable - friendly and attentive but not at all nosey! Grocery stores, cafes, and subway access super close by. Felt safe my entire stay.",5
"The hotel has an amazing location and a great team. I’m a flight attendant so I’m very familiar with the chain and the customer service is great. The only little thing was the elevator, it really took us a long time every time we wanted to go down but besides that everything was amazing. Thank you so much!",5
"This hotel is in a perfect location to walk to both time square, Rockefeller Center & Empire State Building. You have free breakfast and around the clock, hot tea and coffee. Steps away from the hotel there is a 7-Eleven to pick up anything that you need and pretty good pizza on the corner. If you walk the other way, there is a bagel place that has like 25 different types of cream cheese.",5
"Place is what you pay for it’s not bad but could use some improvements, tv was good. The bed was done and no trash around the room/hotel but somethings need extra wiping down and the elevator and some things are a little janky. Breakfast selection was nice and everything else in the hotel is straightforward. For a good price it’s okay.",3
"This was my first stay in NYC, and I was very nervous, especially when I found such a low priced hotel in a perfect location. Great deal, super friendly staff from the airbnb hosts - on site, clear check in and out, breakfast was delicious, valet parking was convenient and quick, and they even texted me after check in to make sure everything was okay with the room. My boyfriend & I will definitely be back!",5
"I was hesitant to book this room because I thought it was strange to book a hotel room through Airbnb, but it worked out fine! The room was messy (some hair and mold in the bathroom, bed unmade when we arrived) but if you’re just looking for a place to sleep and don’t plan on spending much time in the room while visiting NY, it’ll do the job. It was a great deal, so I’d stay again for a short trip.",3
"I feel like we lucked out with this stay! When looking for a hotel I was seeing extremely high prices, until I came along this gem. A good location with super simple check in. In fact we were actually able to check in several hours early which was so helpful! A very responsive host as well.. only complaint is the conditioner bottle in the shower was empty. Would highly recommend!",5
"Superb customer service, from the front desk to the breakfast staff. So accommodating, helpful, kind and respectful. the hotel itself is in a great location.. my daughter and I loved staying here. they let us store our luggage so we could enjoy the day in the city before our flight left. a huge thank you to the entire hotel staff!!",5
"No real complaints. Clean hotel, easy access to subway, kind employees. We did not partake in the continental breakfast so I cannot speak to that. Neighborhood seemed fine. Square Pizza across the street is great for a late night slice and the Joyce Public House restaurant and bar a few businesses down had great food with very reasonable prices.",4
The hotel was exactly like pictures. It was clean and in a great location of Manhattan! We easily walked to many different restaurants and activities. It’s also not far from multiple subway stations for easy access to that as well. Manager would text in to see how the stay was and brought us extra towels quickly at our request. He followed up to ensure we had everything we needed multiple times. It was a great stay!,5
"We had a great stay at the Hampton Inn Midtown Manhattan/Times Square. The location was super easy to get to from JFK and perfect for walking everywhere. We were able to explore so much of the city without constantly needing transportation. If you want convenience, comfort, and a prime spot for sightseeing, this is a great choice!",5
"Location was perfect close to many attractions and restaurants. Staff was quick to respond to any issues we had (like lack of hot water, toiletries). One major set back was elevator service, specially during morning breakfast as they only had two and at times only one was working. One day my boyfriend went up the stairs (to 21st floor) since he had waited over 20 minutes during breakfast. This is not ideal for anyone!",3
"Great stay from start to end. They were gracious enough to allow us to check in at 11:30am, were very friendly and answered any questions we had, and even held onto our luggage after we checked out. Great location, wonderful staff, and honestly just a great hotel over all, especially for the price. Even the bed was nice. Great job - excited to stay again!",5
"Perfect location for a short stay. Location is excellent for walkability- close to Hell’s Kitchen/restaurant row, Times Square, and subway access. The space itself is small but clean and comfortable. We weren’t concerned with space size because we were there to explore. Hotel staff is professional and courteous, host is communicative and friendly. Would definitely stay here again!",5
Excellent pricing for what you get. Typical hotel but not high end. Def could use some renovations and upgrades but the room was clean and halls were quiet. The receptionist had great attitudes. Great location.,4
You are right by the elevator so you can constantly hear it going up and down. The bathroom was pretty dirty. Overall you pay for what you get! If you want a cheap reliable place this is the one for you. Host doesn’t communicate much.,3
"We stayed four nights and the location was very convenient for touristy activities. The bed was comfy and the staff were very friendly and helpful. The hotel is showing it's age a little and is probably due for a refresh, but we'd probably stay again.",4
"The hotel had everything we needed for a weekend away, including an amazing free breakfast and tasty cookies in the evening! The front staff were kind and responsive. The location is great, close enough to walk to/from the train station, shows, shopping, etc!",5
"Great hotel. Nicely priced for its location and services. Only downside is the elevator. Prepare to spend 10mins or more waiting. Otherwise, I had a great say and its a wonderful location.",5
"The staff was very friendly and able to assist with all our needs. Close to Times Square and the Garment District. Very easy to get in and out. Would highly recommend and the free breakfast, amazing!",5
I think that this is definitely a steal for the price. You’re literally right in the middle of all of the tourist stuff. The hosts communicated extremely fast and were kind. I liked that the room was straightened up everyday.,5
The Airbnb was in a great location and walkable to Times Square and multiple subway stations. It was easy to check in and host answered quickly. The rooms were pretty small but the free breakfast made up for it.,5
"10 years on Airbnb Rating, 4 stars , · January 2026 Great place to stay if you want to get around the city conveniently. Breakfast was okay. There were only 2 working elevators that will take ages for you to get in and staff are not that friendly.",4
"This place was great! Very walkable to all the “tourist-y” parts of NYC. Check-in/check-out was very easy and hotel staff were very helpful. We took advantage of the valet parking and concierge service, and it was wonderful. Great price for a busy holiday weekend. Would definitely stay here again!",5
"My friend and I stayed for one night and the room was really comfortable and clean. The hotel was in a nice location, close to a lot of nice stores and restaurants. Time square is in walking distance. The host is very kind and responds quickly!!",5
The room we stayed at was very specious for me. It was clean and well maintained. The hosts were very responsive and helpful. I will definitely be staying here when I come back to NY.,5
"My daughter & I stayed in The Hampton Inn on W 39th St. Friday through Monday. Excellent service, delicious breakfast each morning, and location was within 15-20 mins of all the highlights of NYC. Very reasonable priced",5
"I would not stay here again. although the location was great and the price not too unreasonable, we were given a room with two full beds when we booked a king and nobody could remedy it for us. further, one of the bed sheets had a hole the size of a doorknob in it and we had to ask for a hair dryer and coffee pods because they were not provided. last, the elevator service was so poor that there were often patrons lined up waiting for several elevator runs before they could board.",3
"The accommodations were clean and adequate but not very fancy. The bathroom shower was small and in need of some minor fixes. The free breakfast was very good and the staff was friendly. One of the elevators kept breaking down and since there were only two that meant a long wait at times which wasn’t as big a deal for us on the 5th floor but a big problem for those above us. However, the location was great. We could walk to everything and for the price relative to other hotels in the area it was what you would expect",4
"Great location. Very close to the subway entrance. Enjoyed the king bed. Communication was great, and the hotel staff was very responsive. The free breakfast was a great bonus. Would absolutely stay here again.",5
Good team of people who did a great job with what they have to work with. Great location in midtown which made many of our activities very accessible. They kept things clean and the breakfast team was very accommodating.,5
"Perfect place to just stop, drop, and go out and explore NYC. We were placed next to the elevators so it was bit noisy. But we slept right through it! Perfectly placed and close to everything!",5
Great location. Close to Times Square and wide variety of restaurants. Always felt safe. Front desk staff very friendly and helpful. Hosts were responsive and helpful. I will definitely look for Times Square South when visiting New York again!,5
"For this busy time of year, this place was worth the money based on location, convenience and the staff was extremely welcoming and accommodating! I would book it again.😘",5
The elevators were pretty slow and sometimes there was a long line but thankfully we were on the 5th floor and able to take stairs easily. Other than that stay was great and location was good!,5
great value for money! especially appreciated the free breakfast :) only issue was that the elevator went out at one point and i was on the 19th floor so it was a bit of an inconvenience,4
"I enjoyed my stay here. It was easily accessible and very close to attraction sites. The host was very proactive in reaching out to me to see if I was settling in ok. The staff were also very friendly and helpful. The only problem was that the hot water in the bathroom wasn’t running as it should, however, after calling the front desk, it was fixed for the night but stopped again at dawn. I had to leave because of an early morning flight, so I didn’t call again. That notwithstanding, I’d definitely recommend this place.",5
"stayed here and had a really great experience! the front desk and staff were super sweet and the room was clean. they also were willing to hold our bags before and after checking in/out! can’t ask for much more. one of the only issues was that the shower leaked a LOT, like water all over the floor, but honestly who cares. for the price it was more than worth it. i feel that anyone complaining about the room size or something similar were expecting well beyond their means. stay here if you want a good experience for a really decent price (especially in NYC!)",5
"Out of all the places I’ve stayed in NY, this has to be my fave so far. From the hotel staff to the location, everything was phenomenal. I cannot wait to stay here again.",5
"If you're looking for a place to stay that is on the cheaper end of NY hotels but is still nice, look no further. Clean rooms, nice and helpful staff, and breakfast included.",5
"I really loved the experience of staying here. The location is amazing, few blocks from time square, the stuff was super kind and the room was comfortable. I would definitely come back",5
"Great location, lots to do in a walkable distance, very close to Hudson Yards, good food options, and access to the trains. We had an issue with our first room and the staff took care of it right away. The host was super accommodating, friendly, and responsive. A solid place to stay.",4
"Our stay in NYC was great. Communication with Jason was quick, friendly, and helpful. The Hotel is walking distance to many places to visit around Times Square, Broadway, Rockefeller Center, and even the High Line Park. Subway was easily accessible to get to further places to see.",5
"Convenient location. Water temperature in bathroom was difficult, if not impossible, to control. Lights in elevator were flickering constantly. Otherwise, room was clean and a good value for Midtown Manhattan.",4
"I had a wonderful stay at the Hampton by Hilton on West 39th Street! The location is perfect for exploring New York City, everything is close and easy to reach. The room was spotless, the bed was very comfortable, and the staff were warm, friendly, and always ready to help. Breakfast was a great bonus, and the overall atmosphere felt safe, welcoming, and well organized. I truly enjoyed my stay and would definitely choose this hotel again.",5
"The location of this hotel was great. Right next to the Port Authority, which is access to bus to EWR, and all the major subway lines. Walking to Garment District (MOOD), Theater District, Times Square, Rockefeller, Radio City Music etc. This hotel was just fine with a nice breakfast and friendly helpful staff.",5
"Really good host very responsive, free breakfast which included pancakes, bagels, eggs, sausages etc. The only thing was the cleanliness of the room and the hotel itself. The bathroom could do with a little refurb as there was bits of wall crumbing. There is also only 2 lifts in the hotel which can get extremely busy meaning you might have to use the stairs instead as we ended up waiting 10min for a space in the lift.",4
"The location was good , convenient, close to entertainments. The room was clean and comfy. Breakfast was simple but available. I would advise to go earlier because it got very busy close to 8:00 am. My only thing I didn’t like was very busy elevators and you have to stay in line to get to your floor. Otherwise my stay was pleasant .",4
"Location was as expected & good for our purposes. Staff were pleasant. Perhaps some of what I was disappointed in was listed (very small room & no log in access to streaming on tv) but other aspects of room & hotel were dissatisfying: shower was moldy & the drain cover was missing, very small elevators causing very long waits to use, breakfast was chaotic so we didn’t take advantage of it, hallways & stairwell were not clean.",3
Very comfortable and helpful. They let us check in early and always answered our questions. This hotel is a walking distance to everything we wanted to do! I will definitely be booking again. The only thing I have to say was the bathtub floor was dirty and didn’t feel too sanitary but everything else was perf.,5
"Perfect location just minutes walk from the time square and metro. This place is quite convenient, just a short walk from Times Square and the metro. It’s easy to access a variety of restaurants, shops, and all the usual attractions in the area. A decent spot if you're looking to be close to the action without being right in the middle of it.",5
"The location is great for visiting Time Square and popular pizza/bagels spots - Joe's, Liberty Bagel, PopUp Bagel - to name a few. In addition, the staff are all friendly and helpful, especially when it came to early check in and storing our bags. We were specifically looking for a clean place to stay as NYC is known to be dirty and/or outdated, and this hotel was spotless. For our first time in NYC, we're glad we stayed here!",5
"I really enjoyed my stay at the Hampton Inn Times Square. The location was perfect, and the breakfast provided each morning was a highlight. Cesar was exceptional, he brought so much energy and warmth to the breakfast experience, making it one of my favorite parts of the stay. Rooms were standard, clean, and stocked 🙏🏼",5
"We were so impressed with our stay! Our room was super clean. The bed and linens were really comfy, too. I was most relieved about the mirrors and lighting in the bathroom! It made getting ready to go out a breeze. The staff was really responsive and checked in multiple times to make sure we had everything we needed. I would definitely stay again.",5
"We had an amazing stay at the Hampton Inn Times Square! The room was cozy, and the location couldn’t be better, right in the heart of Times Square with everything easily accessible. The service was exceptional, and the host & the staff were incredibly responsive, ensuring a smooth and enjoyable stay. I highly recommend this place for anyone visiting NYC!",5
"This was a great experience, as it was a regular hotel room with all the usual amenities close to Time Square (but not too close). The rate was amazing (including American Breakfast with omelette, sausage, fried potatoes)! Waffles were served by the amazing and very friendly breakfast staff.",5
"Besides first going to the Times Square location from the train station, walking by 39th on the way, in below zero wind chill, we enjoyed ourselves! My bad, girlfriend forgave me.",5
"Great place. Close to Times Square and many food options available including quick food and sit down options, we stayed one day and a night, very clean and comfortable. The only downside I was a little disappointed when I learned that we couldn’t make the waffles ourselves. Normally that decision wouldn’t bother me but the lady who was making them was cleaning and walking around at the same time which I appreciate bc she’s keeping it clean but she was wearing a mask that wasn’t coving her nose and she repeatedly coughed into her ungloved hand and didn’t sanitize them before taking the food off the burner. That absolutely canceled the point of the mask and the point of not having hundreds of hands touching the maker.",4
"I gave this 4 stars only because it didnt include a microeave in the room and a place to wash clothes. However theres a microwave downstairs and a laundrymat a block away. The room was clean and matched the description, my host kept in contact with me throughout the trip. The free breakfast is one of the best parts of the trip, NY food can be expensive and this helps with the prices a little by providing you a big breakfast. A thing to keep in mind is this hotel is in times square but if your thinking about the main plaza like one times sqaure, your going to have to walk a couple blocks. If you able bodied its not that bad of a walk and there are lots of things close by like broadway. I recommend getting this hotel.",4
"The Hampton is located just a block or so off Times Square. This made getting around New York as easy as it can be. The staff were always friendly and the room was tidy and cleaned daily during my stay. You could tell my particular room had sustained water damage and some point and has never been properly repaired. The entire room sloped towards the outside of the building so much so that the shower pan wouldn’t drain correctly and the door on the wardrobe wouldn’t stay open. The TV was also very dated and the cable cut in and out frequently. If you want a room that’s convenient it is that, otherwise it’s not worth the price as they do not do any repairs or updates with the amenities.",3
"Overall, the hotel was moderately clean and the staff were professional and kind. However, there were several issues that made the stay frustrating. There were only two elevators in the entire hotel for both guests and staff, which caused long delays. We stayed on the 15th floor and ended up walking down all 15 flights of stairs with our luggage so we wouldn’t miss our flight. We called the elevator three times, and each time the wait was at least 5 to 10 minutes, and the elevators were completely full. While the hotel was affordable, I would not stay here again. The room temperature was also very uncomfortable, constantly switching between unbearably hot and unbearably cold.",2
The airbnb host Quinn was always responsive and gave answers to my question. Jessica at the front desk went above & beyond giving directions and suggestions. The door person found a taxi cheaper than Lyft getting there. Wonderful place to stay!,5
"Dirty rugs, noisy place, mirrors disfigured, bed linens with black lint throughout, safe didn't work (wouldn't lock), no cookies at 3 pm - 5pm as promised, dirty elevators. TV not programed with time nor date. The owners need to remodel, do upgrades. I know this is a busy Hampton Inn due to the location of Times Square, but you can do remodeling floor by floor until completed. Only lose a few bucks spread out over time and happier guests. I've owned 2 businesses and this is not the ideal way to satisfy a guest/client. I will never stay here again; not up to my cleanliness standards. Highlights: The breakfast guy is helpful and cheery housekeeping did an great job. Check in & out easy.",3
"The stay was pleasant. The elevator wasn't working on Saturday morning, but they had a technician who was on site and operated it manually so we could get to our appointment without delay.",4
"such a great hotel that’s close to ALL of the touristy things! Times Square, Central Park, Liberty Bagels, and just a short Subway ride from the financial district. Easy to navigate and off in a slightly more slow street which was nice for sleeping at night.",5
"It was all about convenience for me and needed to be in the center of attractions and this place nailed the spot. I was very satisfied. The rooms were clean. Staff was friendly. Breakfast was, just OK. But overall, my trip was a success.",5
"As someone who has never been to New York City before, I thought it was easy to find, it was clean, and it was close to everything to we could walk. Staff was also very friendly",5
"As a solo female traveller I felt safe and accommodated. Staff was friendly and helpful. It is mid-town so do not expect a big hotel but everything was clean, bed was comfortable and the buffet was perfect!",5
"Loved this stay. I normally prefer apts. and less hotels. But in this case, the room was great. The Location was great. Free breakfast every day and 27/4 tea and coffee stations which was perfect for me as I caught a cold! Such good value for money. A big LIKE.",5
"This place was fine. And that what I would call it. Good location, nice staff, the place is mostly clean.(dirty under the mattress but the sheets were clean which is what counts) But it is a cheaper place to stay. So you pay for what you get. It gets the job done.",4
"Place is as described. Rooms are small but clean. Location is great. Right in the middle of Times Square and walkable to most places. Elevator wait times is a real problem. But if you are patient and ignore that, it’s not too bad. Breakfast is okay.",4
The hotel is close to everything that you would want. -time square -restaurants -shopping -subway stations Just make sure you prepare some place to park before you go. Room was comfy and was cleaned daily. If you are looking for views this is not the place,5
This was a perfect place to stay in Midtown. The property was off the strip so we didn’t hear any noise. The area was very safe and a 20 minute walk to everything. The hosts checked in with me to make sure our stay was going well. Would definitely stay here again. Thank you.,5
"A nice place to stay if you are just looking for somewhere to rest and get ready at. Pretty small but it worked for our weekend. We were able to check-in early without requesting an early check-in and staff were nice. Elevators took a long time and had broken lights. The room was fine including a king size bed and mini fridge. The water in the shower backed up and the floor was a little dirty. Walking distance to Hell's Kitchen, Theater District, Time Square, and more. The street itself was a little run down but easy to get to other parts of the city.",4
"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ 5/5 — Perfect Manhattan Stay! Our stay at this Airbnb in New York City was absolutely amazing! The apartment was spotless — super clean, modern, and comfortable. The location couldn’t have been better — right in Manhattan and walking distance to so many great restaurants, shops, and attractions. It was incredibly convenient for exploring the city, and everything we needed was close by. Check-in was smooth, and the host was friendly and responsive. We couldn’t have asked for a better place to stay — definitely recommend it to anyone visiting New York!",5
"For my first visit to NYC, the location of the room was perfect. It was close to a subway and I was able to walk to Broadway for two shows, Times Square, and Macy’s. A little further walk to Central Park. I was able to get sound sleep with the room being quiet and with a comfortable and clean bed.",5
"Because I had booked two separate rooms, and used my name on both, the desk could not locate the second room upon arrival in their system. Instead of a hassle, the clerk person found the glitch between AirBnB and their system, and rectified everything efficiently and swiftly. Throughout our two-day stay, we found the personnel to be exceptionally friendly and helpful with bags and information. The location, near 39th and 9th Avenue, was just right for our needs. Thanks for making our stay pleasant.",5
"Although small the hotel Is in a great location, the staff was friendly and attentive! The only issue I had was that our room was close by the elevator and we heard all the noise. Otherwise it was clean and close to all the NYC attractions! We’d defiantly book again.",4
"The staff here were great, the room was nice, the location was great. Only thing we didn’t like was the curtain in our room didn’t fully close. From out side looking up at our room, it appeared there were only a few rooms that had our issue possibly. The curtain mount itself didn’t allow for it to close and the apartments directly across from us could see right in. Also the only ice machine that worked was in the basement. Other than that we enjoyed our stay.",4
"I had a terrible experience. The rooms smelled bad, the towels were extremely foul-smelling to the point that it was disgusting to dry myself with them, and my sheets had yellow stains and even blood — yes, blood. This is absolutely unacceptable! On top of that, at check-in I was told there would be a $150 fee held until check-out and that it would be refunded instantly. However, when I checked out, I was informed that it actually takes five business days for the money to be returned. This is nothing but lies and complete disregard for the guest.",1
"This was a great hotel for a solo female traveler. The location was great for getting to lots of areas - Chelsea, upper east & west side, plus the theater district. Lots to do and really nice staff. Would definitely recommend!",5
"We enjoyed our stay at this hotel! The location is super convenient, and this is a great value stay for such an expensive area generally. We would stay here again for sure.",4
"I enjoyed my stay at Times Square South, the room was nice and breakfast was great too, but there’re some minor things like it doesn’t have new furniture, it might be old or a bit dirty. But in general it was a good experience.",4
Everything went very smoothly with check-in. The interface between the hotel and AirBnB was seamless. The front desk staff were welcoming and friendly. The room itself was adequate for our needs. The hotel felt safe. I would stay here again.,4
"This location is poorly maintained. The elevators are super small and the entire lobby area is in need of maintenance and cleaning. The room was ok, but the vents on the AC unit were cloggy and the carpets were gross!",3
It’s the Hampton Inn and booking through Airbnb was a lot cheaper than booking through Hilton. Great location for me as I took the bus to Manhattan and the hotel is 3 min walk from Port Authority Bus Terminal. It's also very close to Times Square.,5
After waiting to get checked in we missed our tour and it was my birthday so it was ruined. The host took a while to respond while dealing with this. There were people everywhere waiting on their room to be cleaned. Once we got our room the mirror had some kind of symbols written on them and they never came to clean it or remove it. The shower floor was missing and hard to stand on. Host was bad and hotel was as well. Now the location is the only thing that was good about it all.,1
We were on a two day mother/son trip to New York. We saw four shows and walked to Central Park and Times Square. Our stay was exactly what we needed. The hotel was clean and safe and the location could not have been better. We easily walked from the train station to the hotel to drop our bags. The staff were amazing. They were very nice and helpful and kept our bags before we checked in and after we checked out so we did not have to try to drag them through theatres. It was just a great stay. Thank you!,5
"This place was very clean & quiet, nice stay for a couple of days, Times Square just a few blocks away walking distance! Served free breakfast which was a plus! Only thing I wish os that it had some sort of bluetooth or fire stick/cable for TV.. Other than that, i’d book again!",4
"Very happy with our short stay here. Great location, easily walkable to Broadway shows, etc. We arrived early and were able to check in upon arrival. Front desk attendant was very welcoming! Rooms were clean and comfy.",5
"It is hard to find a better value for money in New York, with hosts who reply in under 10 minutes. The place is clean and spacious, check-in and check-out were smooth, and it’s definitely a convenient choice for a budget-friendly stay in NYC even though the rooms are elegant.",5
"Location, location, location! This was perfect for our extra night we decided to spend in NYC. Close to Times Square and close to the subway. The room was perfect for just my husband and I. We could see the top of the Empire State Building from our room. Would definitely stay here again.",5
Great place to stay! The hotel was decent for NYC in size and clean! The view was great!!! The elevators do take a long time sometimes but that is sometimes to be expected. Definitely would book again (:,5
I was a little bit worried when I saw the reviews about the cleanliness since I am a germaphobe myself but it was spotless. The front desk was super welcoming and polite. The location was perfect and the room was really cozy.,5
"my husband and I planned a one night getaway to NY City. where we stayed was perfect as we could walk pretty much anywhere we wanted to go. It was clean, quiet, and comfortable. we couldn't have asked for more! Thankyou!",5
"I didn't actually get to stay at this hotel. When I arrived, they said they had no rooms and took me to a hostel two doors down. The service was excellent, but then the new hostel overcharged my credit card without informing me. I asked the front desk about it after I noticed that I was being charged for extra cost, and they said it was a mistake and they would refund the money. But I still feel bad.",3
The room was perfect with in suite bathroom & full length mirror. Very walkable to public transit. Generous complimentary breakfast as this room is located inside a Hampton by Hilton. Only Two elevators to service 32 floors. Wait times are long during morning breakfast and check out.,5
"11 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · August 2025 Lovely comfortable and well presented room. The provision of coffee and biscuits at the check-in were a surprise bonus. The accommodation was very handy to all the main New York attractions- very walkable. I would recommend the hotel for a visit.",5
Definitely worth it! Great location + great amenities! Comes with free breakfast which is good for the price! Employees were very friendly and very helpful. Highly recommend! Definitely coming back! ☺️☺️,5
"10 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · August 2025 Easy walk from Pen Station to this Airbnb. Great location and very quiet which is a surprise for New York City. I enjoyed the late checkout and that I can leave my bags there after checkout. Comfy bed and no issues at all. Would highly recommend for anyone staying in NYC",5
"My stay was delightful. Everything was clean, staff was friendly, and the location was perfect for walking.",5
A very comfortable place to stay near Times Square! The room was clean and service was amazing!,5
"This was an extra night we had to do, so we had to schedule the extra night through here, but here is the review again: Location was perfect! You are just a block away from the street that will take you directly to times square, also you have one of the main subway stations just a couple of blocks away and everything seems super close. Staff is superfriendly on main desk, on breakfast, cleaning; all of them were super helpful and great; We had to stay an extra night due to a winter storm and they were super helpful to make sure we didn't have any extra inconvenience. Internet is not that great but I managed to have some calls and work a bit from the hotel. Only real drawback we really had was about the elevators. One broke down on the second day so you have to wait a long time to go either up or down during peak hours, and it wasn't fixed in the full 7 extra days we stayed there.",5
"Had a great stay at this location. central for all that NYC has to offer and short walk from times square. Beds are very comfy and rooms are clean and cozy, but the place is very dated. Not worth the price we paid. I have to say that although the guy at breakfast was really nice and cheerful, the breakfast experience was not the best. We were unable to have breakfast on 2 of the days, due to there being to many people and not enough seating. people were taking there food to the rooms if and when they could get to the food. The lifts were broken throughout our stay, with only one lift working. My family had to drag their cases down 7 flights of stairs when we were checking out as the lift that was working was full for over 1 hour so difficult to get in with the amount of people using them. it was stressful. People corrugated outside the lift and the space was only wide enough for one person, made it difficult to assess. Staff were lovely, friendly and professional. made to feel welcome.",3
Great stay. Easy check in and walkable distance to Times Square. We just needed a place to sleep and shower and this was perfect.,5
Very nice 3 star hotel. The staff were friendly and super responsive to the couple of issues that we had. The location is excellent. Great value for the price!,5
"Great location, hotel room clean and comfy bed. We had a great stay and would definitely return when next in New York, many thanks",5
"Good hotel for the price! 10 mins from Time Square, lots of good food options, 10 minutes from the Manhattan Center!",4
"While I was very stressed out over the hotel not having our correct reservation due to rebooking issues (I was reassured after my partner informed me people could own hotel rooms in New York 😅), eventually the reservation was put in place successfully and we were able to check in with no problem. Traveling can be really stressful and the hosts were communicative and helpful, especially when I was very stressed over our booking. The location is in a wonderful area, reasonable distance between all sight seeing and nearby transportations. There’s a 20.00 shuttle from the airport to a ten minute walk from the hotel. Thank you to the hosts for their patience and ensuring my reservation was in placed through my travel panic, the stay once the reservation was in place was smooth and wonderful!",5
"Great place and super affordable for the area, you are in walking distance of most things and if you’re not the subway is down the street",5
Great stay! Super convenient to Times Square. Everything was as described. No issues at all. Would definitely stay here again.,5
"Nice location, small but cozy room, friendly and helpful staff, I would have given a 5-star review if it were not for what we experienced during the first night. During the stay of our first night, the heating system in the room did not work. The room was too cold to fall asleep in NYC's freezing December. At around 5:00 a.m., I went to the front desk and reported the issue. Later, an engineer confirmed that the heat had broken. We were then transferred to another room. After the transfer, I noticed that there was a clearly installed control panel on the wall for the heating system, while there were only exposed screws at the same place in the previous room. This indicated that the hotel should have already known the failure of the amenity, but they still assigned the room to me. I requested a refund for the first night. So far, the hotel hasn't responded, even after the intervention of Airbnb. Anyway, this might be a good place most of the time, but be aware of the risk.",2
"This was a great location. The room was nice and spacious. Elevator took a long time so try getting rooms on the lower floor. But, overall a really great location.",4
Nice place. Off the busy section so not too much noise. Easy to walk to everything we wanted to see.,5
"Great location, and solid amenities for the price. Room was clean and as advertised. Would stay here again!",5
The host at the hotel was awesome she helped a lot with parking as well. Also Cesar who served breakfast in the am was amazing and u can tell he loves his job.,4
"The hotel was amazing! A 10 minute walk to Times Square, and super close to other attractions too! The room was spacious and super clean. Highly recommend!",5
"The room was clean, the beds were comfortable, the staff was helpful! Good price for the location.",5
"Great hotel, great and friendly staff, kind and responsive host. The hotel and location was well worth the money for the NYC/times square experience. Host was very responsive and kind for any questions or concerns. The hotel was clean, nice and the staff was great. Breakfast was just a typical hotel breakfast with amazing waffles with any toppings you’d like, the hotel staff even made the waffles for us and wrapped it up for us when we wanted to take them up and eat in the room but there was plenty of room in the dining areas to eat as well. As read in other reviews the elevator could be slow at times during breakfast rush, or check in times, but other than that I hardly waited for an elevator and most of the time rode it completely by myself with nobody else inside even during Christmas time. Everything went amazingly and I 10000% recommend this location and host. Thank you so much again! And we will be back for our next trip to Times Square :)",5
"It was exactly as expected. Generally clean hotel room with a king bed, bathroom and mini fridge. We stayed during the Christmas holidays. The staff were very friendly and helpful. They held our bags before check in and after check out so we could walk around without them. The elevators were working perfectly fine despite negative reviews about them. Location is great, on a non busy street but still a 5 min walk to times Square, Bryant Park etc. Was it small? Sure but its a hotel room in NYC I'm not sure why people are expecting spacious - and you aren't there to hang out in the room. Its perfect for changing, sleeping, showering etc. Exactly what you need it for. Only qualm was the toilet was kind of broken. The handle wasnt really working and you had to push down REALLY hard to flush. But I'm sure they will fix that. Also, it isn't fancy by any means and is slightly dated but that doesn't bother us. But I know it does for some people. We would stay again!",4
"It was a beautiful place to stay, small, quiet, friendly and within walking distance of Times Square and many other restaurants and places",5
Perfect location close to all subways and quiet but still near Times Square. Bed was comfy and free breakfast was amazing and everyone was super friendly,5
"Great hotel, good location, comfy bed, nice workers. Only complaint is it’s about a 20 minute wait for an elevator in the morning",4
The location was excellent but the price was a lot (I guess nyc prices but still) for a very basic hotel. Breakfast was also very limited.,3
"Great location, very friendly staff, close to all the perfect restaurants and sights to see. Will be staying here again next time i’m in NYC!",5
Good location in garment district. Walkable to most places you want to be during holidays.,4
"We loved staying here! The staff were nice and helpful, great breakfast, great location, and very clean! Would stay again!",5
"Great location, the staff was friendly and all needs meet. Enjoyed the waffles for breakfast 😋 Would definitely stay again",5
The room was great The hotel was great location especially everything for the price we received The staff was amazing It was perfect for a mother-daughter trip,5
Great location and they held my luggage since we got there early. Staff was very nice and room was clean. My only complaint would be the elevators were very slow.,4
Communication was great throughout. The front desk was very helpful in printing a few documents needed for a business presentation. All staff members were very friendly.,5
"Everything was as described, and super close to Times Square. Plenty of different eating places to go to, within 20 minutes of walking.",5
"Facilites are great, very convenient, very close to the heart of Manhattan, accesible to public transportation and breakfast included makes a difference",5
The location was ideal and the space was all we needed. Highly recommend for anyone interested in the attractions midtown NYC has to offer!,5
I enjoyed my Stay. The area was very nice and busy lots of places to eat and being able to see the city was amazing.,5
"The hotel met my expectations. I had no issues with check-in. The elevator was quite busy during peak hours, but fortunately, I was on the 4th floor and could often take the stairs. The hallways were somewhat dirty, but the room itself was clean. The neighborhood felt a little sketchy at night, and they lock the doors at 11 PM; however, you can still get in with a keycard. Booking through Airbnb means you won’t earn hotel rewards points, but it still counts as a stay. Overall, I was happy with my stay. I didn’t reach out to the host, but they appeared to be readily available if needed. I would stay here again and book with this host in the future.",5
"The staff is very friendly, helpful and responsive. The hotel needs an upgrade. The bed was not that comfortable, the carpet needs a really good shampooing or better yet to be replaced. We didn't want to walk on it with our bare feet. The lock on the safe in our room didn't work. The stairs, which we used a lot, seem to be missing from their cleaning list. The lobby needs an upgrade. The breakfast is extensive with juices, eggs, all types of breads, muffins, pancakes, oatmeal and more. The location is fabulous, easy access to subways and main transfer stations. It's a very active hotel with lots of groups coming and going which was not an issue for us, yet might be an issue for others as the lobby has a tiny footprint.",3
"We had a good stay at this hotel. Check-in and check-out were quick and easy, and the staff were friendly and attentive throughout our visit. When we arrived, they let us leave our luggage at the front desk before check-in, and our room was ready a couple of hours early, which we really appreciated. The room had a fair amount of space and while the building is a bit older and the showers were small, it didn’t take away from our stay. Our refrigerator wasn’t very cold, and when we asked the front desk if they could store our cheesecake for us, they gladly did. Overall, everything went smoothly and the staff made sure we were taken care of.",5
This place was fantastic. Perfect area for travellers and such a fantastic room. Wish I had booked them for my second leg! Definitely got spoiled when I saw my next Airbnb was like.,5
"I had a wonderful stay at the Hampton Inn Times Square! The location couldn’t be better—just steps away from Broadway, restaurants, and all the action of the city, yet the hotel itself was quiet and comfortable. The staff was friendly, professional, and always willing to help with directions or recommendations. The room was very cozy, smaller than expected. The complimentary breakfast was a nice bonus and saved me time before heading out for the day. Check-in/check-out was smooth and hassle-free. Overall, this hotel is a great choice for anyone visiting New York and wanting convenience, comfort, and great service.",5
"The hotel provides a basic stay at a reasonable price, for Manhatten. There was shower gel, shampoo, conditioner, body lotion and hand wash all provided. Towels, bed linen, fridge and coffee maker also in the room. The TV is very old and probably the original from when the hotel was established. This could do with an upgrade. There was housekeeping daily who made the bed, refreshed the towels and coffee, however, they seemed to not vacuum the floor, which needed doing by the middle of the week. A very basic hot breakfast along with oatmeal, yogurts, cereals and bread were complimentary with the stay. The Wales were made fresh for you if you wanted them.",4
You cannot beat the location! We stayed for two days to see 3 Broadway shows and the location was perfect. The only negative part was the bathroom wasn’t cleaned well before we checked in. The lobby staff were so helpful and kind and we were able to leave our luggage before and after our stay for hours so we didn’t have to lug it around the city.,4
"Had a great stay. Was super convenient with the location being so close to times square and manhattan. I could easily get to any train I needed to. Close to all the shopping and restaurants you can think of. Furniture is definitely a little outdated, however was still worth the value. Front desk was kind and super helpful and the breakfast was def an added plus!",5
"It was a nice place to crash for the night. I am a near freak though and found a hair stuck in a pillow. The shower was not very clean, stuff left on the floor. The toilet had a hair in it and toilet paper and was not flushed. Besides that it was very comfy and good walking distance to pretty much everything we wanted to see!! Looks just like the listing",4
"I had an excellent experience at this hotel! From check-in to check-out, everything was smooth and pleasant. The room was clean, comfortable, and well-equipped, and the overall atmosphere of the hotel was welcoming and relaxing. Thank you to the entire hotel team for making my stay so enjoyable — I truly appreciate your efforts!",5
We had a great stay at the hotel! It is extremely well located with it being just a short walk over to Times Square. It’s also an easy walk up to Central Park or to access the subway and other locations in the city. We enjoyed the breakfast and had a wonderful man help us make waffles. Thank you for the stay!,5
It was my first time in the big apple and I choose to stay here it’s the perfect location it’s not to far from Times Square it’s lots of stores / things to do in the area it’s also 2 parking garage on the block so that made parking easy … check in was a breeze/ quick the staff was very friendly and I enjoyed my stay I’ll return when I come back to nyc,5
"Overall the stay was quite bad, the room smelled as you enter, the place is quite small, things are broken - for example the tap works but clearly needs repair as it is loose from the base and is barely holding, the shower is small, and the ac handle is broken as well, the windows dont open so you can not do anything about the smell as well",2
"We had a great stay! Great location with plenty of things to do. We were in a room next to the elevators and couldn’t hear them at all. Occasionally we heard some street traffic but nothing to be bothersome. Complimentary breakfast was lackluster but there’s plenty of great breakfast spots in the area to make up for it. Overall, we would stay again.",5
"I would definitely recommend this spot to future guests. The room was clean, their staff was very friendly , and their continental breakfast was great. Lastly, this spot is in an ideal location in Manhattan as it is close to a lot of tourist activities. I will keep this place on my list for future visits!",5
"Low end place, strangely enough they made me write extra info down after I gave my ID and Card, they continued to charge me double the normal deductible rate. Then I get to my room and the door didn’t work unless I yanked on it then pushed, fought with the door every time. The room was small and not worth what I paid for, I’ve stayed at nicer places for cheaper",3
"My travel partner and I had a wonderful stay! The hotel staff was helpful and friendly. The photos and description in the listing were accurate, and the room had more space than we expected. Elevator wait times were always short for us, and it moves quickly! Our room was next to the elevator but we didn't notice excess noise from the room. The included breakfast was a nice perk.",5
"Great place to stay in the city for a getaway!! Pretty close to the Subway, Times Square & Hudson Yards. Breakfast was better than what I expected, and I’m grateful we got a good deal here. Also very thankful that the front desk staff was able to keep our bags in the back before check-in and after check-out, so we could enjoy touring the city peacefully!",5
The hotel room was clean and the breakfast was as described. Only complaints we had were the mattress was pretty uncomfortable and the AC unit was very rattly so it wasn’t great for those of us who like white noise at night. Other than that the staff was very friendly and it was exactly as described.,3
Convenient location and close to Times Square. The hosts are very responsive and would check in via text if I needed anything during my stay. It was nice to have the hot breakfast because I was able to get out and start my day earlier. The only downside was it can get pretty crowded in the cafeteria room during breakfast & there's only 2 elevators for the whole hotel so there can be a wait depending on when you need it.,5
Clean and convenient. It was easy from check-in to check-out. I would definitely consider this place again.,5
No staff was present to help with my luggage while checking in and had only 2 lifts for 20 floors. Everything else was fine.,4
small room but great location and flexible check in time!! overall good stay,4
Great place to stay. Great staff and right in the center of everything to do in the big city.,5
Located in the perfect place and definitely worth booking! We hope to be back here again soon,5
"Absolutely incredible location, price, and a decent breakfast too. Would stay again.",5
"Excellent location, great host and yummy breakfast! We will definitely return!",5
"A nice, simple place located not far from Penn Station. Overall, recommended.",4
Very nice staffs… special the waffle maker and kitchen staff…,5
It’s the Hampton Inn. There was no issue booking though AirBnB. My Hilton status was recognized and points accrued.,5
Great for our stay in NYC to see a play. Could walk to our theater on Broadway.,5
Had a great stay! Thanks to the staff who were always so kind with all of my inquiries!,5
"It was my first time booking on Airbnb, and unfortunately it wasn’t a great experience. Jason was not helpful or understanding, so I will not be booking with him again.",1
"Good servis and close to all public transportation and very close to the city center time Square. maintain your friendliness in service, always be successful",4
"Exactly as advertised, friendly staff, nice breakfast. Clean and staff very efficient.",5
Great location close to Times Square. Enjoyed the free breakfast!,5
"everything was great, good location, breakfast, except for the elevator which was out of service for an entire day",5
"Great location, friendly staff especially gentleman making waffles and front desk staff. Room decedent.",5
Responsive host. The included breakfast was ok - there was only ever 2-3 select hot food options.,5
"i don’t enjoy giving a bad review but i feel obligated to truthful. the place was dirty. check in person was lovely, all other employees somber. great location.",3
Everything was great. Cozy and clean room and very central to get to the tourist spots in NYC and also the subway is very close. Can recommend!,5
Perfect for our 1 night stay after a concert at MSG. Great location to walk 15 mins either way to MSG or Grand Central.,5
Hosts communicated quickly and were very helpful. Hotel was clean and a good amount of space for two people.,5
"Great location, helpful staff, & clean rooms! Waiting for the elevator was not as bad as made out to be in other reviews (in my opinion)!",5
Great communication. Room was clean and comfortable. Minor requests were addressed promptly.,5
"This hotel is very conveniently located, between 8th and 9th Ave. The Valet Parking is very convenient, although it is perhaps $10 - $15 more per day than would be the case at one of the local garages--but, the convenience for someone arriving with luggage was well worth the extra few dollars. The people at the front desk were very helpful in all ways. The breakfast is very good, including omelets or scrambled eggs as well as sausage and good oatmeal and nice baked goods. I have only one slight complaint: the two elevators are very small, and it can take many, many minutes during the morning hours to catch an elevator that isn't full. There are at least 30 stories, and so it actually becomes very inconvenient to have to wait for an elevator (for example) when going upstairs after breakfast. I organized my day around this without much difficulty, including checking out very early in the morning. The room was spotless. It was not huge, but it had everything necessary.",5
"Came early after long flight Front desk provided us with early check in which we deeply appreciated Clean rooms, good location",5
Great for a one night stay in NYC. Close to Times Square and held bags before check in and after check out.,5
"I will say that this was one of the cheaper options for a 1-night stay in NYC. I guess you get what you pay for. Check-in was quick. They do charge you for incidentals that are reimbursed to you after your stay. There are only 2 elevators for the whole hotel so waiting to get up and down takes a good 15 minutes. We did not have a working TV our whole stay, no big deal, we were only there for 1 night. We did have an issue with the toilet. After flushing, it kept running water and overflowed. Huge mess. Our door to the room did not close all the way unless you pulled it shut. Huge security issue especially since we were in the room right next to the elevators. Staff was fine. Not great, not bad. Given the choice, I probably wouldn't stay here again.",2
"Location is good, moderately well lit, still need to be conscious of safety walking late in the evening. Staff was amazing. Lady who checked us in at around 1 AM on 9/30/25 was an angel. Check in was delayed for some reason, but she took care of us with Water and a late check out time so we could get some rest. That lady needs a RAISE. 10/10 Housekeeping and breakfast staff were also VERY kind and accommodating. I do wish breakfast went until 10:30 AM at least. Breakfast options were pretty “basic“ but there were many options so that was wonderful. Building was clean and well lit. The room had quite a bit of wear and tear but the linens and bathroom were especially clean looking and the small was mostly neutral, which is really what matters in my book. Bed was comfortable, pillows were NOT. Appear to be some sort of down filling that looked fluffy but flattened as soon as you used it. If you like flat overly squishy pillows you’re in luck. Would stay again if the price was the same.",4
Great location. In the heart of time square area. Great price compared to other searches. Great room.,5
"The hotel is in an amazing location. The neighbourhood is safe and very close to Times Square. The breakfast was good. The staff at the front desk is very nice, but not really offering solutions or compensation if you have any issues. About the room, for that price, it’s unacceptable to find the carpet wet and dirty on multiple spots. I had to wash my socks in the sink because I accidentally step on the wet part of the carpet and they became black. We then had to leave a towel to be able to walk on that spot which was exactly in front of the bed. Plus the bed sheets were completely dirty, with multiple black marks. We asked for new one, but since it was 2 am no one from the cleaning staff was there so we had to remake the bed by ourselves which wouldn’t have been a problem at all if only they would have provided us with the right sheets, king size, instead, they gave us queen size",3
"We were arriving late (like 1am). The gift wasn’t sure how to address this with the hotel, and the hotel typically marks anyone who hasn’t arrived by midnight as a no show. But, one of the hotel employees gave me an email address for the company that owns the hotel. I sent an email and within minutes received confirmation that we wouldn’t be marked as a no show, and the person also provided me with a complimentary late checkout. It was awesome. The hotel itself is in a perfect location, the hotel team was amazing, and we had a blast in NYC. The hotel location was so great that we walked and took the subway everywhere and easily saved hundreds of dollars on taxis/ubers. And, booking a room through AirBnB saved us hundreds of dollars as compared to booking through the hotel directly. Long and short is that we knew we weren’t going to be in the hotel room very much because we were going to concerts and clubs, so this was perfect for us.",5
"NYC is expensive, but this fare was one of the lowest we could find and the description matched everything to a T. Would stay again.",5
"Absolutely no-fuss, but convenient location, and a safe place to get a good night's sleep. Recommend!",5
Convenient to Time Square and Broadway NYC close to everything including the subway. I would stay here again in the future.,5
Room and Bathroom was very clean. They cleaned our room every day. Definitely recommended for the stay in NYC.,5
"The hotel room was clean, the staff were accommodating, the the location was really good. I found this hotel perfect for my NYC trip.",5
"Pros: - easy check-in, but can be a long line - only 2 attendants, and they have 30+ floors of guests - valet parking $75/night - can call ahead of time for a rush pickup - otherwise allow 60-75 min - free breakfast - more reasonable pricing for Manhattan - King bed Cons: - unclean - food leftovers from prior guest was not cleaned from pantry - manager was responsive about the above, but did not actually take action - small room - might bump into glass in shower - way too many guests for only 2 elevators - can be 10-15 min wait times in the mornings - free breakfast very crowded, but the servers work quickly - some furniture was damaged - weird smell, but could be from the food as described above - gym did not have treadmill - only elliptical, bike, and free weights",2
"9 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · August 2025 Great place to stay in the heart of Manhattan! It's in close proximity to the subway and the host was very responsive and helpful.",5
"For the location and free breakfast, it's pretty reasonably priced compared to other hotels in the same area.",4
Very clean room and great location. Good breakfast options too and everyone is very friendly! Only thing was the ad said a hair dryer was included and didn’t see one,5
Loved the stay. Close to Time Square and the 42nd street station. A great central location to get to about anywhere in New York.,5
"The location is really great, very convenient and enjoyable. The staff was friendly and provided good service. I had a very pleasant stay and would definitely recommend this hotel!",5
Good stay. Very helpful and accommodative receptionist who assisted with checking in. There was a slight issue with a roof leak in the room originally assigned but this was resolved promptly by allocating us a different room. Happy with the experience.,4
"We enjoyed our stay in this place. We visited New York for the first time and the only thing we needed was a good location, a decent breakfast, and a good bed! It was satisfying in overall.",5
"Wonderful staff onsite, allows you to leave your bags so that you can walk around without carrying them prior to check in. Check in was early at 2. Check out at 12. Location right next to the train. I can’t complain",5
"I really appreciate the gentleman who makes the waffles in the daily breakfast area. Very friendly, helpful, and patient. The ice machines on several floors do not work though.",5
"Not 1 complaint from my roommate and I. The room was perfectly furnished and well equipped with everything we needed. If it were possible for me to leave more than 5 stars, I WOULD. The location was not far from the heart of the city in Times Square. Many beautiful memories were created, and it all began with a lovely team hosting 2 Texas skaters who rested comfortably and felt almost at home. Thank you all very much for hosting us. We look forward to returning and booking with your team again in the near future!",5
"7 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · August 2025 It was a great stay. Host was responsive and welcoming. Location is super awesome and is just 5 minutes walk from Times square and the edge. Room and washroom was clean and equipped with all the amenities. Overall a great stay.",5
"These are rooms in an operating Hampton, so it’s not a traditional Airbnb. The hotel staff was responsive and helpful. Facilities were clean and up to date, including the elevators. Location is excellent. A great value!",5
"Great location, easily walkable to local attractions, easy check in/out . The front desk was able to hold our luggage for the day. Breakfast was good . Will definitely stay here again",5
"We enjoyed the experience. The host responded quickly and efficiently. Everything was laid out clearly. It is in a great centralized location to Times Square and lots of public transportation. The staff at the hotel were friendly, helpful, and kind. Overall a great stay and experience.",5
"I’m very happy with our stay. Check in was very easy! We stayed on the 15th floor, it was quiet and easy to access. The hotel was located on a somewhat quiet street but within walking distance to Times Square and the subway. The price was perfect and we are very glad to have found this place!",5
"The Hotel room was clean, temperature was perfect, space was ample. The location was so close to transit and walkable to ferry to Weehawken. Price was good for what we got. I would stay here again for sure. Thanks so much! Also our deposit was returned when we left the hotel.",5
"Really good hotel! Clean, comfortable rooms that include a small fridge (I like keeping some cold drinks in there). Everyone working here was super friendly, and they also helped me out when I wanted to extend my stay by a couple days. I liked the coffee and breakfast too.",5
"I had a great stay — the staff were very thoughtful and checked in daily to see if we needed anything. The hotel was well-located, and the complimentary breakfast was a nice bonus.",5
"We loved our stay! Check-In was at 3pm, but we were able to check in early which was perfect because our broadway show was at 2pm. The Front Desk was super helpful even though it was a busy Saturday afternoon. They cared for us, even pointed out I should move my car to avoid a parking ticket! No hidden fees. Everything is clearly stated in the instructions they send you. Also, there were no issues booking thru Air-BNB instead of the hotel’s website. We only stayed 1 night, but it was the perfect crash pad after a long day of tourism!",5
"We had an amazing stay! Great price! Easy to walk anywhere in downtown nyc from the apartment. Will definitely book again for future nyc trips. Easy check-in, valet parking service for a reasonable price as well.",5
"Close to Times Square to walk there. A good base for a short stay, suiting our 2 night break. Family friendly and friendly, helpful staff. It is in a busy district so not a retreat in the city - it serves its visitors comfortably, suitable for Broadway breaks etc and for public transit.",5
"This location was perfect. Six minutes from the Port Authority in mid-town. Eight mins walk to Times Square. The hotel gave a gift bag with bottled water when we arrived which was great! The room was awesome. Big comfortable clean bed. Clean bathroom with a very nice tiled shower. We had a huge flat screen tv which was nice and the AC kept our room very cool during the hot muggy days we had. Our host Saud, was very responsive and helped us get checked in quickly and met our every need!",5
"Overall, it matched the pictures was easy to navigate the city with such a central location. The only downside was the elevators in the morning. depending on how busy breakfast was the elevators could get a little backed up.",4
"3 years on Airbnb Rating, 4 stars , · July 2025 Good location. Room was clean and the elevator was much faster than expected. Hotel could use some updating and be cleaner with friendlier receptionists but overall a good stay.",4
"This was an awesome place for us to spend the night as we traveled through New York City! A short walk away from Times Square! The manager Saud checked on us and was there to help us. Easy check-in, easy check-out. Would recommend, and I can’t wait to stay here again!",5
"When arriving didn’t had rooms available for my reservation, had to pay a lot more to stay in another hotel for the night because they never filme about the situation prior to arriving. At that time goons were extremely expensive around. Didn’t made an extra effort to accommodate me in another place.",1
"I am a working Playwright based in Los Angeles and come to New York frequently, so I’m always looking for a reasonably priced nice place to stay in the heart of the beauty district. This place was exactly what I wanted and I would stay here again and again.",5
Great location and the room was clean. Free breakfast too. Give yourself plenty of time for the elevator. The $150 security deposit upon arrival after already having paid in advance for both nights was a ‘surprise’ for an AirBnB but it is what it is I guess? Other than that it was great.,4
"Actually a hotel in New York city. Good location. My room was not available when I arrived. but they escorted me next door where I was efficiently checked in to a very clean and comfortable room. Communication with host was always quick, courteous and helpful. Good stay.",5
"Great stay. Clean room. Would definitely choose this option in the future. Wish there was more to the fitness center (only one elliptical, bike, and some dumbbells), but as expected. Thank you!",5
Perfect stay and location. Had a problem checking in because they couldn't find my name (possibly booked under another name?). But outside of that it was absolutely perfect!,4
"I had an excellent experience and my stay and location was perfect. My room was clean, comfortable, and surprisingly quiet considering the bustling location. The complimentary breakfast offered a great variety of options and saved me time and money each morning. The staff was consistently friendly and helpful, especially when I needed directions and restaurant recommendations. The free WiFi worked perfectly throughout my stay. I particularly appreciated the security measures in place, requiring key card access after hours. I would gladly stay here again on my next visit to NYC",5
"I was surprised it was a hotel. Has 2 elevators that are small so during busy times you have to wait a long time to get down. My husband walked down from the 24th floor because it was taking so long. Then discovered a door handle to the main floor was missing so had to go to the basement and walk out to the street. Also there wasn’t a phone in the room to call the front desk and no number easily available to call with our mobile phone. It definitely needs a face lift, but the bed was comfortable and close to many things.",3
"Very happy with our stay! We had fresh towels everyday and our room was tidied. Hotel staff were very nice and attentive. It was very easy to find and there were many places to eat very close by. Would definitely recommend and if we ever return to the city, we would stay here again!",5
Central location to the train and time square. I was afraid this location was going to be loud but it wasn’t. We had a furniture issue but that was quickly addressed by the host and hotel.,5
Stayed here for a conference at Javits. Great walking location. The hotel itself is pretty out of date but it does the job. Friendly staff. Slow elevators (2x that I could see) which the cleaning staff also have to share using over 30 floors.,5
"The location is excellent, and the cleaning team is professional, providing daily service. While the bathroom equipment is somewhat outdated, it remains functional and ensures a seamless experience. Despite being in the heart of Manhattan, you can still enjoy a restful sleep.",5
"I loved the extra perks. Most places don't give you water, snacks AND cookies! Plus, the room had alot of space and gave what it needed for a hotel in the theater district. Definitely a good deal!",5
Great location! Very accessible to hot spots in NYC. Definitely closest to Times Square and all that stuff. Overall for the price and location you literally will not find better. It is inside of the Hampton inn hotel!,5
"needed an affordable room for two nights in Manhattan and this place delivered. Nice place, friendly staff, and kudos to the guy who makes breakfast because I showed up 30 minutes after breakfast closed and he kindly got me a bagel and turned the toaster back on for me to toast it, and even offered to re-start the Waffle maker. Front desk was helpful and fast, getting Ubers in and out was easy, and it was in a great location. five stars all around !",5
"Great stay, clean, only there one night went to two shows in two days. Very accommodating, kept up with text messages, answered promptly, can’t wait to come back! Thanks so much!",5
"Great location, nice stay. Highly recommended. It was close to subway as well. They also hold your bags after checking out, so you can walk around the city without carrying them.",5
The location and ease of access was great! I really enjoyed how I could leave my hotel at any time and have easy access to Times Square. The subway system being right around the corner was so convenient as well!,5
"Walking distance to Broadway theaters, Carnegie Hall, Empire State Building, Chelsea, etc. and the subway station was ust a couple blocks away. The room was spacious and very well equipped for the price. Lots of good, affordable places to eat on 9th avenue, and most of the high-end midtown restaurants were in walking distance. The elevators were sometimes slow, and the business center was used for storage during my stay, but they were minor issues you'd have to expect at any affordable places in New York.",5
"This was a very affordable and decent option for staying in Times Square. Honestly, my only complaint was how slow the elevator is. Definitely don’t try and leave the hotel in a hurry because the elevator will surely take a very long time. I was on the 27th floor and probably waited close to 15 minutes for the elevator to reach me. There are only two, and one of them was out of order one of the days I stayed there. Otherwise great spot.",4
"I want to pubicly thank Jason and Sade. Jason for being very responsive and helping me out with my very late check-in and arranging that for me (after midnight). Sade for helping me out with directions, offering advice about he locale, and even with getting a cab. She really went the second mile for me and I appreciate it. I would also like to shout out to the breakfast crew. I felt impressed by their degree of hustle and making sure all of the guests were served and fed. Truly a remarkable team.",5
"Loved this hotel!! Highly recommend, not too loud, very clean, house keeping comes everyday, AMAZING breakfast options, good walk to everything including times square being less than a 10 min walk. I would say spacious for a NYC place also.",5
"The hotel was very clean, and the staff was friendly and helpful. The location is perfect just a short walk to Times Square and close to the subway, making it easy to get around. Breakfast was also good with a nice variety. Highly recommanded.",5
"We have stayed here a couple of times but this time, I checked in late due to delayed flight and they were so responsive and accommodating. They gave me a higher level room which was great. Walking distance to Port Authority Bus & Times Square. Subway is within the Port Authority bus so everything is so accessible. Free Breakfast was really good. Just make sure to go down early cause it could get crowded. They also store luggages for checked out guests for free. I would definitely recommend this place & will surely book it again.",5
Great staff and clean space near everything.,5
Place was a great stay close to everything including subways. Would stay here again,5
Great neighborhood web tons of great places to eat. Right by Broadway for shows.,5

this place has been by far the best one i have stayed at in nyc. the host was amazing in all aspects from booking to checkout. 10/10 experience. 10/10 recommend.,5

Great value for location and service that comes with complimentary full breakfast,5
wish the phone was plugged in and worked but other than that. it was wonderful. also the tv needs to be upgraded to a smart tv. we were bored while In the room,5
"Stayed next door 2 days wasn’t the best stay, came here for 2 days got cool customer service first off, then they put me super high up loved that, then my room was in the back away from elevators. They took care of me for sure! Appreciate younger Spanish lady @ front desk!",5
"7 years on Airbnb Rating, 4 stars , · August 2025 we are satisfied with our stay, only one thing ,I ve to tell I ve requested for upper floor but I received 3 rd floor rest all are ok ...nice maintained n friendly place",4
"The room was clean and comfortable. The tv situation was not so good (I'm not sure why MSNBC wasn't available). The listing said there was wifi, but in fact the wifi was fairly limited unless one paid an extra five dollars. I was stuck in the elevator with some other people when I was trying to leave. We were out fairly quickly--maybe 15 minutes. When we did get out a member of staff sort of yelled at us because apparently there were too many people in the elevator (I don't remember seeing a notice about a limit, although he said there was). In any case I would gladly stay there again.",5
"Booked this hotel through Airbnb and everything seemed fine until I showed up to check in at the front desk. Not only did the lobby smell horrible, the front desk said the booking was a mistake and all rooms were full. Front desk was helpful in explaining that the hosts were given ample time to cancel the reservation due to lack of rooms, but did not do so. Explained the situation to the hosts, who had already reached out previously to tell me my room was ready, and they were the opposite of helpful. They refused to cancel my reservation and refund me and didn’t even offer to help find alternate accommodation. I was alone around midnight in the middle of Times Square and hosts were not helpful or empathetic.",1
"our stay at the hotel was great. it was great that the hotel had breakfast and we could explore the city within walking distance. another big plus was that there was a metro nearby. living here we understood that this is a tourist area, and there are a lot of different strange people around, as well as homeless people. but for us it was not a problem, as the hotel itself was good and the location was completely suitable. so if you are interested in the sights in this area, this hotel is for you. if you want a quiet holiday, you need another area. the only negative, in the room I found a cockroach. I ask the staff to pay attention to this. overall it was clean and comfortable",5
"I’ll definitely come back, an incredible location",5
"4 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · 2 weeks ago Amazing! Thanks for everything",5
I enjoyed my stay would book again,5
"Very conveniently located, it was possible to walk to all the famous places. Excellent breakfast every day. Very friendly staff and they received several packages that I sent to the hotel. The only downside is that you had to wait for the elevator sometimes because there are only two elevators and 32 floors. But despite that, highly recommended and great value for money. Translated from Spanish Show original",5
"Excellent hotel, value for money, very good location. Small downside, you can't close the curtains because of the air conditioning block in the room, you shouldn't be afraid to sleep with the light on. The other downside is the inability to add an extra night on site, you have to go through the platform and the prices vary enormously upwards. Otherwise, very good stay overall. Translated from French Show original",4
"Location is great but the room was a bit dirty and the air conditioning was very strange to use and a bit broken. The bed was also a bit stained. Unfortunately, there was also no blanket cover and only a thin blanket. But the location makes up for the price and the free breakfast was American but okay Translated from German Show original",4
Great stay. Close to everything we had on the bucket list.,5
Great location at a great price!,5
Awesome place to stay in Times Square.,5
"Great place to stay, walking distance to a lot",5
"It was the holiday season in December, and the yen was weak, so I had a hard time finding a place to stay for 4 nights, but this place is in a very convenient location within 15 minutes of Times Square and Grand Central Station, and despite being a Hilton, it was relatively reasonably priced, which was very helpful. It was quiet at night, and there were many 7-Eleven, fast food stores, and restaurants in the area, so I had no trouble eating. A fridge, safe, and hair dryer are also provided. Although the air conditioner was a bit old, the room temperature was stable and we had a pleasant time. You can also take an Uber in front of the hotel. During our 4-night stay, the bathroom and sheets were cleaned daily, and we had a peaceful stay. Breakfast is delicious and there is a service that bakes waffles. The menu changes daily, but the omelet with vegetables, bacon, and cheese was especially delicious and my favorite. Also, the host provided check-in instructions and messages about the trip, which made me feel warm. The only thing that bothered me was the crowded elevator. We stayed as a couple, but we were over capacity and had to wait a few times, and we were a little tired when we had to wait about 15 minutes to go down from the 16th floor to the 1st floor. The employees use the same elevator as the guests, and I don't know if it was a malfunction or why, but it frequently stopped on floors where no one was there, and the wait time felt even longer that day. I'm sorry to ask for a personal request, but I would appreciate it if you could avoid using the elevator for cleaning as much as possible during the busy breakfast hours (6:00-10:00). During non-crowded hours, I was able to use it smoothly without any particular problems. Apart from the above, it was a very pleasant stay overall. I was able to leave my carry-on bag after check-out, so I was able to walk around the city for a few hours before going to the airport, and I really enjoyed my first trip to New York. Translated from Japanese Show original",5
Great stay! no complaints! Would do again. Loved it.,5
Great location. It’s a nice hotel,5
All around excellent! Would stay again.,5
"I was surprised by the room, it's exactly as pictured, it's VERY comfortable. My check-in was early, which is very good for those who arrive early after hours on the plane. The reception was ready to assist us. For sure, I'll be back. And the communication was excellent too! And having breakfast included is excellent, it's a basic breakfast but it's worth it! Translated from Portuguese Show original",5

"6 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · August 2025 Comfortable bed loved the room thank you!",5
"The host doesnt appear to communicate with the hotel at all. concerns I've voiced to them they passed the ball and told me to call the hotel directly instead of managing it, it was always my responsibility to figure it out. housekeeping stole my sheet & then refused to look for it because it was also white, even though it was a completely different texture & thickness. I was told a manager would email or call me within 24 hours about compensation - NO ONE has. I told yhe host about it and they passed the buck & told me to call the hotel. I did 3 times and each time no one answered. I bring my own sheets for a REASON, I have photos of the stains on the sheets there but they dont seem to care. also they say they have ice on 3 floors, only 1 of the machines work. long wait for elevators. extremely disappointed with the lack of customer service & follow up",2
"Great location, great host. The hotel was a little dated but it has everything you need for the price. Would book again.",5
"Conveniently located, comfortable room. Very responsive host, good customer service. Decent breakfast. Would recommend.",5
"We loved the location, check-in experience and the room. The breakfast was excellent. We were impressed with the man that was making waffles for the guests. Great value!",5
"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ A Perfect Stay in the Heart of NYC! I recently stayed at the Hampton Inn Times Square South and had a fantastic experience from start to finish. The location is unbeatable—just a short walk to Times Square, subway stations, and plenty of great restaurants and attractions. The staff were incredibly welcoming and helpful, always ready to assist with a smile. Our room was clean, comfortable, and surprisingly quiet considering the busy area. The beds were cozy, and the bathroom was spotless with good water pressure. Breakfast each morning was a great bonus—fresh, hot options with something for everyone. We also appreciated the free coffee and tea available throughout the day. If you’re looking for a convenient, comfortable, and affordable place to stay in Manhattan, this is it. Would definitely stay here again!",5
"My wife and I had a great stay! Awesome location! Great value for the price, even free breakfast! Host was very responsive.",5
Very easy to find! Walking distance to lots of things! Definitely coming back in a few months!,5
"Look, this is a Hampton Inn, so it's not REALLY an Air BnB experience. However, I got a great rate going through Air BnB and had all the upside of staying at a brand hotel: it was a safe and predictable experience, with a familiar room, decent workout facility, free breakfast (nothing to sneeze at in NYC!), friendly front desk staff (shout out to Fran!), housekeeping, cable TV, ice machines, complimentary water bottles and snacks upon check-in, etc. Room was small, as expected in Midtown Manhattan, but it was very comfortable for one person, the AC worked brilliantly during a stretch of grossly hot weather and the water temperature and pressure from the sink and the shower were great. Convenient location between 8th & 9th Aves, walkable to Times Square and major bus and subway lines, and yet pretty quiet at night. Really good pizza place across the street - although it's New York, so there's really good pizza every couple of blocks....",5
"I had a wonderful stay at the Hilton Hampton Inn in South Times Square, New York. The reception staff were extremely courteous and went out of their way to make my visit comfortable. I was pleasantly surprised to be offered both early check-in and late check-out, which made my travel experience much smoother. Throughout my stay, the team was responsive and helpful, promptly addressing any concerns with practical and thoughtful solutions. Their service exceeded my expectations, and I truly appreciated the attention to detail and hospitality. The hotel also offers very competitive rates for the area, making it a great value for money. I highly recommend this property to anyone visiting New York—whether for business or leisure—looking for a clean, convenient, and welcoming place to stay.",5
"Great Stay – Would Definitely Come Back! I was pleasantly surprised by how spacious the room was—it wasn’t as small as I expected, especially for New York City. It was more than enough room since we were out exploring most of the day. The air conditioning worked perfectly, and there was plenty of hot water in the shower, which was a big plus. The hotel was very clean, and I loved that there was always fresh coffee available. Check-in and check-out were smooth, and the elevator was quick after check in and check out The only downside was the valet parking—it’s definitely pricey, but that’s to be expected in the city. The elevator takes long during check in and check out so just plan time wisely but should be expected it’s NYC lots of people Valet broke a piece on my door and I got no accident report for it (small piece but still ) Overall, I’d 100% stay here again. Highly recommend!",5
"We loved it! the breakfast and staff were so kind and helpful, we definitely will come back ♥️♥️♥️♥️",5

Clean room. GREAT location. Breakfast was great. Times Square 5-10 min walk. I definitely recommend,5
Great stay!! The room is lovely and clean. The location is perfect. Will come back any chance I have.,5
"I had a fantastic experience at the Hampton Inn, and I have to give a special shoutout to Fran at the front desk. From the moment I walked in, Fran greeted me with a warm smile and made me feel instantly welcomed. She was not only friendly but also incredibly helpful, answering all my questions and making check-in a breeze. The hotel itself was clean, comfortable, and well-maintained. The room was spacious and quiet, with a cozy bed and everything I needed for a restful night. The complimentary breakfast was fresh and well-stocked, with plenty of options to choose from. What really made this stay stand out was the excellent customer service, especially from Fran. She went above and beyond to ensure my visit was pleasant. It’s not often you meet someone so genuinely kind and professional.",5
Perfect spot! Everything was close by didn’t have to pay for uber or anything! And the room was spotless!,5
Great location right in the heart of Midtown. Avoid bringing a car if you can because parking fees are very high.,5
For a hefty price you’re getting what you’d usually expect. The elevators are incredibly slow but staff is equally as pleasant and helpful.,4
"1 year on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · July 2025 Excellent location. Clean, but small rooms. Sumptuous breakfast. It was wonderful to stay with the property. Highly recommended",5
The property was in a great location and the room was clean! Breakfast was a nice addition. 😊,5
Good location. But they forgot to clean up our room for the third day. The breakfast was really good. The sheet smells like piss.,4
We really enjoyed stay at the hotel. The position is very good according to all attractions what we wanted to see. The room was clean and breakfast was good.,5
Everything went Well. Free Breakfast was Good. And Close enough to walk to Time Square and Broadway.,5
"This place is great for those who are looking to be out in the city. You are close to the mall, Subway access and most New York landmarks. I enjoyed my time here.",5
It was close to everything. The price wasnt too bad. The hotel/room could use some updating/work.,3
It’s was a great location. We came from Lincoln tunnel and it was an easy in and out of Manhattan and perfect location to stay and meet family,5
The stay here was great! Very accessible and easy to communicate with the hosts! Will book again! :),5
"I ended up booking this spot at the last minute during a very busy time in NYC, so options were limited. This listing is actually a hotel room right in the heart of Times Square, and while the location was convenient and the staff were friendly and helpful, the property definitely needs some updates. The room was fine overall—comfortable bed and decent amenities—but the bathroom was a major downside. The shower had a handheld head that wouldn’t stay in place, causing water to spill everywhere. I had to wipe the floor after every shower. The hardware was rusty, and the wallpaper was peeling—definitely not what you’d expect for the price. Elevators were slow, one had flickering lights, and my room key stopped working multiple times. At one point, I needed staff to let me in because the key card machine was down. On the plus side, the breakfast and coffee were both good and a nice way to start the day. Overall, this stay was okay in a pinch, but the property definitely needs updates.",3
The room smelled like wet dog. In all fairness they offered to move me but I was too busy. The entire property needs to be upgraded or remain inferior.,2
"1 year on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · May 2025 It's a real hotel, and me and my boyfriend are so satisfied with the stay. There was dusty part in the bathroom, but other than that, it is absolutely great.",5
We had a great time. Very nice hotel with breakfast included. Great location. You can leave your luggage there to hold for free after you check out.,5
A very nice place! The staff are amazing and the location makes it easy to do things in the city. Also very very affordable will definitely be coming back again,5
"Do not stay here! This is a hotel being operated in an unreliable and confusing manner via AirBnB. We payed for an ostensibly non-refundable room and received detailed confirmation of the booking and all appropriate information for check-in. Yet when we arrived to check-in, which happened to be very late (around midnight) due to delayed trains, we were told that there were no rooms and that we should contact AirBnB for a refund. The receptionist was rude and dismissive and offered no help in providing a refund or in finding us other accommodations in the area (i.e. in Times Square at midnight!). I have requested a refund via AirBnB and am awaiting news from both AirBnB and ""Times Square South NYC."" I have no meaningful news from either and ""Times Square South NYC"" has been evasive and noncommittal in their communication. All in all, an awful experience. This is an irresponsible, disorganized and misleading establishment that does not deserve your money.",1
Location was close to TS. Room was sparkling clean and amenities were great. I stayed for a night and only for few hours but worth the value. Highly recommend.,5
Life savers!! Loved the place. Felt extremely cozy and the staff were super kind. Also they let us check in a little bit earlier than anticipated,5
"We stayed just a few hours, but it was enough, great place, very quiet and everything is close. Definitely, I recommend them",5

"Good location, walking distance to most sightseeing places. The breakfast was treat. We had a pleasant stay.",5
I was able to book through airb&b the day of. Everyone on staff was friendly and helpful. The price was great and everything they listed was there,5
This hotel was perfect for our short stay! It was a close walk to many restaurants & easy access to subway.,5
"This AirB&B is for a hotel run by Hilton/Hampton group and not a home. I've never stayed in Manhattan before, so for my experience, it was a great location. We were able to walk to Times Square, our Theater, and Central Park. There are loads of bars, eateries and shops all around, so never a lack for something to do. It's a smaller space, so do not expect to have a place to sit other than the bed while having any downtime in the room. Also, the shower door frame was out of alignment so the doors did not slide well and kept falling off the track (but not out of the channel). Still, the room was clean, the staff friendly enough. It was as quiet as one might expect in the middle of the city. There was an option for parking, however it was double what I was able to find on SpotHero. There is breakfast available and it's not bad, (though I recommend just eating in the city). The problem is the dining area is small and the crowd was large. All in all a great value and stay.",4
Great location and comfortable room. My Au Pair stayed for 5 nights and was happy with everything!,5

"Great location, close to everything on foot and close to the Metro. Very, very friendly and respectful staff. When I asked for help, they answered my questions, giving directions in English and Spanish. They gave advice on transportation, restaurants and NY attractions. For the price of hotels in NY, this hotel is an excellent option, for its price-quality ratio. And as an extra, the simple but very sufficient breakfast included, allows you to save and go for a walk with a good coffee!!!! Translated from Spanish Show original",5

"All in all, we were very please. The breakfast was perfect, there was everything to get full. The service there was also very friendly. The location is perfect, relatively many sights are within walking distance. What bothered us a bit was the thin duvet in winter, which also somehow had no real cover and that the shower had sprayed into the bathroom. I had to say 3x that the food from the previous tenant is removed from the refrigerator, which already stank a lot. Unfortunately, we were unable to use the refrigerator.

"DO NOT BOOK THROUGH THIS LISTING! Book directly through the hotel. This listing is hosted by folks in another country and, while kind, they will not honor their own policies. They say they allow cancellation or modification up to 24 hours before check-in but, if they do not see your request in time due to their time zone (Air BnB told me the host of this listing is located in the Philippines) they will NOT honor it even if you request a change prior to the deadline. And Air BnB will not require them to comply because (and I quote) “The host is not responding”. Literally, they said they would not require the host to comply with my modification request because the host just wouldn’t respond to them. This is wild to me! So I’m out about $200 AND had to spend hours on the phone with Hilton confirming I would be arriving a different day (they also would not honor a refund) AND with Air BnB trying, unsuccessfully, to get this resolved. SKIP THIS LISTING if you can.",3
Santiago I believe was his name was amazing on checking in top tier that’s for sure Fly eagles fly baby,5
"Excellent choice in location, cost, cleanliness, service. Everything!! We arrived before check-in time, our room was available and they assigned it to us without waiting. That certainly got the trip off to a great start! Translated from Spanish Show original",5
An excellent location. It is close to all the key points to visit. It has a good breakfast service. I had a pleasant stay without any inconvenience. Thank you very much. I'll be back. Translated from Spanish Show original,5
"The location is perfect, you can go to many places on foot, the elevator did not work for a whole morning, I had to go down the stairs twice, the breakfasts are fine, but there is a lack of variety. Translated from Spanish Show original",3
It was great!,5
"The perfect room, the location is very good to go to any attraction with the Metro nearby and a safe area. We didn't like the breakfast and the elevator waiting issue. The rest was VERY GOOD. Translated from Spanish Show original",4

"Very nice welcome, the team is responsive and does their best to make your stay pleasant. Great breakfast team. I enjoyed the reception of eight and that of the day. Hotel in a very good location between Time Square and Penn Station. I recommend it! Thanks to the whole team! Translated from French Show original",5
"Ideal hotel location near Times Square. Beware, late at night there are a lot of drug addicts in front of the hotel. Free breakfast with lots of different things to eat. unfortunately the cleaning in the bedroom was not great, stain on the sheets, bed bugs. Translated from French Show original",3

Great stay. Location was perfect.,5
Very responsive host. Excellent host & location,5
"Great location, very nice and clean",5
"Overall satisfied with our stay. I'd probably give the room 4 stars because it was pretty cramped and there were a couple of minor issues upon check-in (hot water not working, light bulb out, etc). However, I'd give the staff 5 stars for their responsiveness, including to the aforementioned issues, as well as their general helpfulness and attitude.",4
"Great location in Manhattan, very close to Times Square and Empire State Building and convenient to take metros. Free breakfast and coffee is awesome, staffs are nice, you can save at least $100 per day via Airbnb than booking room from hotel directly. Just regret that I didn't reserve enough days until I found it was little bit expensive to extend the stay.",5
"A great place to stay. Room was very clean, no odors. The bathroom was very clean as well. Good breakfast. One of the workers (didn't catch his name) that was there during breakfast was very welcoming, offered assistance with making waffles :) My room was right next to the elevator, but the noise level in the hall was minimal. I would definitely recommend staying here and would consider booking again. Keep up the great work. Thank you!",5
"This is a Hampton Inn hotel and it left a lot to be desired. The bed sank when you sat on it and should be replaced. The wifi was barely usable. The window curtains don’t fully close, so light comes in in the morning. The bathroom door wouldn’t stay open. In the positive side, the front desk staff were friendly and the location was convenient.",3
"This is a Hampton Inn hotel. Overall, I was happy with my stay. The room is small, but I think this is expected in NYC. The free breakfast was a nice touch and very convenient. The elevators were slow sometimes like other reviews say, but it didn't bother me too much since we didn't spend too much time at the hotel anyway.",5
"10 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · August 2024 I was pleasantly surprised with the size of the room and the facilities available. We had a king bed, desk, smart TV, coffee machine and fridge. The bathroom was generous in size and clean. The breakfast included had great options and the coffee was great! Location was perfect close to the underground, time square and heaps of food options.",5
"What an incredible host. From booking to checkout, Adam was extremely responsive and always willing to help in any way possible. His place is perfect for any trip to the Big Apple. I loved it so much I extended for a few days and Adam made me feel so welcomed!! I would personally give the place 10 stars!! Highly recommend ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",5
Adam’s listing was as described and perfectly peaceful in a city that can feel chaotic at times. It’s probably the time of year but there was barely any street noise and the backyard area was a nice little place to relax.,5
"Adam was a great host—very responsive, always replying within two hours and providing all the answers I needed. He even let me check in a little early since my flight arrived ahead of schedule. The room was spotless and very comfortable, with a huge TV that was a fantastic bonus. The location couldn’t be better—there are plenty of spots nearby for breakfast or a quick bite, and the pier is just a two-minute walk away. Everything was perfect!",5
My girlfriend and I stayed here for a birthday weekend getaway. We stumbled onto this place and because it was close to where we wanted to go we chose it. Very walkable and there’s a target pretty close by for any essentials. Buses also available pretty close. All in all it was a great stay and would definitely recommend.,5
Great private room with a shared kitchen and bathroom! Will come back again if we go on another New York cruise. Minutes of walk away from the pier. Location is king!,5
"My girlfriend and I had saved up a while for a trip to NYC and we were super excited, but ended up leaving early because this place was terrible. First the apartment was not very easy to enter and the owner was unresponsive entirely for 12 hours. When we did manage to get in side the apartment was not well kept, the outdoor area was gross and there was a hot tub with goopy brown liquid oozing out of it. The bathroom was just generally nasty and had to be shared with multiple people. Additionally, we didn’t know there were was going to be other people there as it was never specified in the post and for the price I would absolutely never recommend or come back to this place.",1
"Great host and great space! We had a little mixup with the provided key fob for the space, but hopefully that was all resolved, and you are able to get into the room using your phone as a key fob! Overall, I fully intend to book the space again in the future, as it was very comfortable, easy to find & and a full yard for my service animal that I brought along with me😀😀",5
Fantastic stay ! Adam was super responsive and very accommodating. Thank you so much Adam!,5
"very clean space, great location, responsive host. would absolutely stay here again! Thanks so much, Adam!",5
"The apartment is centrally located (Google Maps is showing the street next to it.!) , quiet, and within easy reach of Times Square. The kitchen was clean and well equipped. However, my room had a serious ant problem — even on the bed, and unfortunately, I got bitten. On the balcony, there was a dirty bathtub that should be either thoroughly cleaned or removed. It smells bad and attracts insects and mosquitoes. Aside from that, the price is very reasonable compared to other places in NYC.",3
My stay was really great. The instructions were easy to follow. The neighborhood is primarily what I was focused on for my stay and the location is very walkable to many areas of the city and public transportation.,5
Amazing stay! Location was great and Adam was so kind and flexible to our needs.,5
"Great place, 15 min from town square, 30 mins from Central Park, 10 min from cruise port !!!",5
"You can beat this place for its price. Simple, to the point, quiet, and comfortable.",5
"Adam was a fantastic host, very kind and responsive....even left coffee candies, it's like he knew coffee is my love language. I would definitely have him host again",5
"The room is clean before i arrived,and easy to check in.but a lots flying and ants after raining,so i can't sleep all night..",3
"Nice little room in Manhattan, super close to everything. Make sure you bring cash if you want to do laundry!",5
"Adams’s place was very quiet, within a great location and had good security. On the other hand, my girlfriend and I contracted bed bugs after staying there, not having had any bites or bugs on us until the 2 night stay. There was a dead mouse in the bathroom, and bed bugs found in downstairs shower/tub. There were stains on the towels, which were still damp, but we did get new ones provided after requesting. Adam wasn’t very responsive, if it all, but when I asked for two accommodations, he did respect them (leave bags in common room after check out to go eat food before leaving the city, letting us arrive a little early from check in time). The hot tub pool for my patio room I payed for was dirty and not useable. If it wasn’t having had bed bug exposure, the overall stay would have been fair to good.",2
"Adam was a great host, and very responsive! The location is great, and you can easily walk around Manhattan.",5
"Adam is a very good host, the neighborhood is close to many places of interest and super quiet for walking at night. I went to a Jazz congress and came back late after each concert and the streets are quiet, there are bars and people on the street. Highly recommended! I would go back! Translated from Spanish Show original",5
Everything is great. The room is perfect for 1-2 people and you are about 13 minutes on foot from Time Square. I never felt unsafe in the area and felt at home in the accommodation. Adam is always easily accessible and very helpful. Would come back anytime. Thanks for this great time. :-) Translated from German Show original,5
Great place and great communication. 100% recommend,5
Excellent location and a short walk to all fun things to do in Times Square,5
"Amazing host, made a request for iron, they literally bought new one with ironing board for me, it was a life saver since i needed for my formals for the convention.",5
"First of all, Luz was really nice and she responded quickly to my questions. The house is very close to Manhattan, and close to a busy neighborhood in North Bergen, but is itself in a quiet area. Perfect for exploring the city and at the same time being able to go back to a calm place to rest. The room was clean, and so was the bathroom. From the bedroom window you can see the skyline of Manhattan. And a few meters down the street you also have a great view over to NYC. I would definitely come back to Luz’ house :)",5
"I had a very pleasant time staying in Luz’s Airbnb, quite literally had no issues. Was my first time visiting New York and New Jersey and wouldn’t have rather stayed in any other place than Airbnb. Very reasonable price and beautiful surrounding area. Not to mention how clean the Airbnb was! Would recommend to anyone!",5
"The room was amazing and exactly as described and shown in the pictures. Bed was comfortable, air conditioner worked flawlessly and really helped with the summer temperatures and it’s a fast 25-min bus trip to NYC. Luz was extremely responsive. I felt at home and would definitely stay there again when visiting NYC in the future!",5
Luz was very responsive but unfortunately room 7 does not heat up. Even with the heat raised the temperature was reading cold temperatures during winter and the room itself was freezing.,3
"One of the most friendly and helpful hosts I ever had! Luz went out of her way to help me with everything I needed and always responded in an instant! Thank you very very much, next time I am in New York I will book your place again! :)",5
Everything was perfect with my stay. I look forward to coming again. Bed was very comfortable and house was very clean.,5
"I had a wonderful stay at Luz’s place! She is an incredibly helpful and kind host, always willing to assist whenever needed. Her hospitality made my stay much more comfortable. The house itself is spotless—clean, well-maintained, and beautifully organized. Everything was neat and tidy, making it a truly pleasant space to relax. I highly recommend staying here to anyone looking for a comfortable and welcoming place.",5
"If you’re looking for a stay with a magnificent view of NYC and a park near by, this is the stay for you.",5
"Great spot super clean, 25 min bus commute to Manhattan and comfortable bed. That’s all I needed",5
"Great location, just a five minute walk to the bus for a 25 ish minute ride which takes you right into New York.",5
Luz was very responsive and kind. The place was clean and safe. instructions were clear. Felt a bit expensive for the kind of amenities provided.,3
"Luz was super communicative and provided a great spot to stay ~30 min bus from the city! Great stay, very clean",5
"Loved working with Luz on my trip to NJ! Very responsive, clear instructions, very easy to get into Manhattan! Will stay there again!",5
"Luz was so helpful and everything was clear and clean , the best part was that NYC is just 20-30 mins by bus , which is 1 min walk from the house",5
This place is very clean and next to multiple bus stops that can get you to bus port authority in 30 mins! And Luz was super nice and replies in no time. Great for the price!,5
"Luz' lodging was perfect for us since we just needed a reasonably priced shelter for our short stay. Both the sleeping and bath room were clean and comfortable (had no need to use anything else), the aircon seemed well maintained. Would definitely stay there again.",5
"10 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · April 2025 It's a great place to crash while exploring New York. Bus stop is a stroll away from the house and there are so many buses options. It takes 18 min to go to NYC. I enjoyed it.",5
"clean, appears as advertised, close to a bus station and a nice park!",5
"7 months on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · August 2025 The place was spotless, including the bathroom, and the hot water worked perfectly for showers. Everything was well-maintained, and the host was very friendly. New York can be busy and crowded, but returning to this peaceful neighborhood was the perfect balance for my trip. The bus stop is just a short walk away, and frequent buses to New York made getting around super convenient. The view along River Road during the ride was stunning, and the skyline view of New York City from West New York is an absolute must-see. We were extremely happy with the accommodation and truly enjoyed a comfortable and pleasant stay. Thank you for making my trip so wonderful!",5
"The room was big and nice. It was easy to checkin. I didn't get to meet the host in person but it was ok. I was expecting a more homely environment but that's more about my expectations than any fault of the place. I'm not super happy about sharing bathrooms but this one was clean and nice so I liked it. It has a nice park nearby. If one needs to go to Manhattan or anywhere to the east it takes a bit too long time and becomes expensive using the bus or rail everyday. But if you're staying in NJ then it's very nice, and has really nice views of Manhattan since the place is by the coast accross from it. I find it worth the price I paid.",5
"Good host, definitely recommend!",5
A very convenient place to access NYC.,4
I had a wonderful stay! the room was super clean,5
"Check-in was extremely easy and there’s a good view of manhattan and walking distance to parks/ local restaurants. Plenty of bus stops nearby so it was very easy to get to NYC taking New Jersey transit. Just note that this is 1 room within a house. At first I thought that meant that I would be the only person staying here because it wasn’t super clear but there’s actually a second floor and a third floor and those are where the other private bedrooms are. It’s not like you’ll be sharing a space with anyone, but you will be sharing a bathroom - there is one on each floor. I think you have to rent to use the microwave or fridge which I think is a little silly especially if you just want to heat up your food. Overall it was very clean and quiet. There’s no central AC but I think each room has a AC window unit and that was enough to keep my room very cool in the third floor. And the shampoo/conditioner/body wash is just a 3-in-one. For the price and location I do think this was a good deal",4
"Great Host, Loved the Place, Easy to move around to NYC!!! Great and Very Kind Host. I’ll recommend for a solo traveler",5
Convenient and accessible place. There is a direct bus to Times Square The rooms are clean and comfortable.,5
Luz was a very responsive and proactive host. Her place is definitely a great value if you want to stay close to NYC.,5
"The place was so clean and look exactly like the pictures. The heating was just right, quiet place and neighborhood. Overall, great experience!",5
"the room is very practical to rest after a day of walking in nyc. It is very clean and comfortable, and the bus station to go to the city is very close. Luz was attentive and communicated the whole time, thanks for your hospitality. Translated from Spanish Show original",4
"Hello, I had a nice stay at Luz's. Comfortable and economical compared to the city center. The Airbnb is located 2 minutes from the bus stop that takes you to the central station/time square. The bus ride is beautiful because you can see Manhattan. It takes about 20 minutes. Buses pass every 10 minutes. That's it! Translated from French Show original",5
"Loved my stay here, would definitely stay again. Liz was very accommodating.",5
Had a lovely stay at Luz's 😊 She was always responsive before and during my stay to answer my questions. Listing was as described. Thank you very much Luz Translated from French Show original,5

Very good accommodation perfectly located next to a bus stop that leads directly to Manhattan Translated from French Show original,5
"Gurhan's place is pretty solid. It is very clean and he is a good guy and a great communicator. The only reason this place isn't getting 5 stars is that the walls are crazy thin. You can pretty much hear the person in the room next to you breathing. Other than that, a great option.",4
"Gurhan’s place was very easy to access by transit, and also to Manhattan by transit. He was very helpful with instructions and also welcoming! The room was small but the kitchen, bathroom and sitting areas were very roomy . Loved how clean it was! It was a good place to stay while visiting downtown NY!!",5
The place was in a very good location and the room was very clean and comfortable. Mr. Gurhan was very friendly and nice to me.,5
"9 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · August 2025 Gurhan was so lovely and helpful. His spot was premised at a great location and very close in the heart of New York",5
"I had a wonderful stay at Gurhan’s place in West New York. The apartment was clean, comfortable, and in a great location. Gurhan was friendly, responsive, and made everything easy. I highly recommend this place to anyone visiting the area!",5
"This is a great place for a basic stay, particularly for singles and not families. it was in an area that was easy to get into Manhattan and lots of excellent restaurants to choose from.",5
Basic and clean room and bathroom.,5
We can hear next room sound but if you wanna stay shortly it’s good,5
"Our stay at Gurhan’s place was absolutely perfect! The place was spotless, stylish, and very comfortable. One of the highlights was the breathtaking skyline view — it was even more beautiful in person than in the photos. The location was super convenient too — just a quick 20-minute ride to Port Authority, making it easy to get into Manhattan while still enjoying a peaceful, scenic home base. Check-in was smooth, and Gurhan was very responsive and helpful throughout our stay. I couldn’t have asked for a better experience and would 100% recommend this place to anyone visiting the area. Can’t wait to come back!",5
I really like this place! Wall is very thin beside that everything was amazing,5
"Thanks Gurhan! Very clean and quiet bedroom, bathroom and kitchen. Location next to NY is beautiful and easy transport access.",5
The place was very clean and well-maintained. Gurhan was polite and friendly. Good value for the money.,5
"Gurhan's place was as described. It is true that the partition separating the rooms is not insulated from noise. The bus passes down the street, which is very convenient, in 25-30 minutes you are on 42nd Avenue in Manhattan. Gurhan was very responsive to my requests! He responds very quickly. It provides a very convenient drinking fountain. I would highly recommend this listing. Translated from French Show original",5
"It was close to the bus stop and easy to get to downtown.Manhattan was clearly visible across the sea, and it was also fun to walk near the house. They helped me carry my luggage, which was very helpful. I didn't use it much this time, but the water server, refrigerator, and kitchen had most of the necessary items. As mentioned in the previous reviews, the walls are certainly thin and you can hear the neighbors, but I didn't mind it much with earphones and earplugs. I want to stay there again. Translated from Japanese Show original",5
"It was very nice to stay with Gurhan, clean place, easy access to NY and the host was very attentive and helpful. Quiet street with shops and markets nearby. I will definitely stay here again when I return to NY. Translated from Portuguese Show original",5
"Very good stay at Gurham's, well located with a 7/11 next door and lots of shops nearby, bus stop just 2 mins from the Airbnb. Gurham is very kind and communicates a lot The only downside is the sound of the wall between the two bedrooms, otherwise nothing to say, very clean house. Translated from French Show original",4
"Gurhan offers a wonderful deal with this room: you will get a place in 30min from NYC, and 2 minutes from a bus stop to Port Authority. All amenities included in the bathroom, towels provided. For 5’9 (176cm) person bed was a little bit high. Only issue is that room C (this one) shares a really thin wall with room B, which results in being able to hear everything that happens in the room nearby clearly. For its price, this place was wonderful",5
"The room more then enough for me,I like the toilet they have water spray to wash,the kitchen is big and full of equipment 😍,the area is awesome with manhattan view at night.!the host Gurhan is very friendly he let me check out bit late cuz was raining,and he also give me umbrella to bring,thanks Gurhan,definitely will come back when visit nyc",5
"Gurhan was super responsive and accommodating, he also shared information regarding transit and was always accessible if needed. The space was clean and comfortable, there was someone who cleaned the shared and vacant spaces daily. I would definitely stay again, the host is friendly and congenial so that’s always a plus! Great host, great space!",5
"My experience at Gurhan's residence was exceptional. I encountered no setbacks during my stay. He is extremely attentive, responds promptly, and resolves any issue with readiness, demonstrating to be a remarkable person. Furthermore, the other people present in the house also proved to be very welcoming. I am immensely grateful for everything and have absolutely nothing to complain about. Thank you very much, Gurhan.",5
Great value considering that you only need to exit Gurhan's property to contemplate the spectacular Manhattan view at night. Bus to the city is down the block and runs all night. The place is quiet and extremely clean. Host & his wife are really kind and Gurhan truly cares about his guests. Thank you so much!,5
"7 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · August 2025 The location of the accommodation was 20 minutes by bus from Manhattan, and it is in a great location for looking at Manhattan from New Jersey. The accommodation was super clean and Gurhan was super kind! Translated from Korean Show original",5
Everything is good except for the noise from the cooler.,4
"Good cosy place to stay during travel to new york. Close to downtown newyork, easily accessible. good view, walkable to bus stop. Host is responsive, friendly and caring.",5
"Great price for the stay! The location is perfect and close to a lot of NYC highlights. The staff were very nice and accommodating. The room itself was great and our partial view of the Empire State Building was a nice surprise. The bathroom was mostly clean, but the tub didn't hold water in for a bath and that was our only issue. It could use some updating. We would stay again.",4
"Great location to Times Square and walkable towards the Empire State Building or to Rockefeller Center area. Like others have said, the staff are helpful and nice and the rooms could use an update but are clean. Elevators are busier during check-in/out times but we never had problems getting to and fro. For the price to be in this location, I would happily stay here again.",5
"Good location, close to all the nyc hot spots. Easy check in and the host communicated well up to our stay. Only reason for the low rating was that during our 3 days stay I was killing bug after bug- especially in the bathroom. It made our stay unsettling and I was shocked especially for the price we paid that I was finding bugs on the bathroom floor, in the stair etc.",2
"Really decent hotel- not fancy but more than adequate. Comfy bed and pillows. Great shower and quick hot water. Very fast elevators. We loved the location with easy access to subway, theaters, eateries, Times Square etc. Next time we’ll bring eye masks for sleeping since the nearby giant billboards are brightly lit all night long. We would definitely stay at this hotel again.",5
"Host were very good in communication. If you want a place thats right in the heart of NYC then this is the place. The room was good overall. A little dated and certain places like bathroom needed a bit more cleaning, but overall was good. If you are not seeking ultra luxury accommodations this place works.",5
"Fantastic location! Although right in the center of Times Square, once in your hotel room (we were on the 36th floor), it was so peaceful and quiet. Staff were very helpful, friendly and welcoming. Only constructive feedback is the lifts were extremely busy and often had to wait up to 15 minutes to get downstairs to the lobby. Would be a huge bonus if food/drink were available to order to the room.",4
"Beautiful lobby. Incredible staff. Especially Mark the bellhop. Bathroom just needs a little scrubbing of walls, but the place was beautiful. And so convenient to the theaters.",4
"Had a great stay in NYC. Hotel was right in the heart on Times Square, walking distance to everything. Top floors were quiet, never had a long wait for the elevators. It was nice to have an entrance on 44th and 45th to get in from the cold.",5
"Had a great stay. Room did not have a coffee pot as listed on the posting. The bathroom sink and tub took a while to drain. Other than that, the hotel staff was friendly and the location was very convenient.",4
The security staff were so nice! Edgar had great pizza suggestions. The location could not have been more perfect. Able to walk almost anywhere we wanted and close to trains for anything we couldn’t walk to. I am definitely going to try to stay here again.,5
"Amazing location in the center of Times Square. The listing doesn’t mention this, I reached out to the hotel itself, but the highest floor they’re technically able to offer you is the 23rd. Anything above that you’ll have to pay extra. Luckily we got an amazing front desk representative that upgraded us to the 33rd at no cost, which had amazing views. Beautiful hotel and perfect location. Would recommend to anyone wanting to stay in the center of the city at low cost.",4
"Great location! Clean enough, ok size of room and bathroom. Has everything you might need in an arms reach around the block, you can see Times Square from the room windows. ( there’s a Starbucks and a Walgreens right below the hotel, literally)",5
"Will continue to stay here every time I come. It’s a great location, especially if it’s your first time visiting NYC! Everyone was very helpful, it was clean, and easy to get to around the city.",5
"Great location, clean room, all as described. Millennium offered to upgrade me to a suite for a modest up-charge, so I did that, and the suite was excellent: full couch, work space, 2 tvs in the room. Would stay again.",5
"The Millennium was everything a Times Square stay should be. Busy, friendly, and exciting. Although somewhat dated (old furniture in room, stains on walls) the bed was pristine and comfortable, and the staff was exceptionally helpful and friendly. Well worth the price.",4
"We had a great time at Millennium Broadway, host was extremely responsive and the location was just steps from Time Square! Great place to stay for a quick trip to NYC, we will definitely be back!",5
"We booked for 5 nights. Upon arrival our room was filthy. Discarded peanuts on the floor, dried urine on the bathroom floor. The room was very dated. We were able to cancel the remaining 4 nights through the hotel. Apparently Airbnb and the hotel staff do not communicate properly. Our cancellation was authorized and within policy however, I had to stop the payment through my credit card. I have never left a negative review, this venue is unacceptable.",1
The staff were fabulous. Truly. Damien especially. He found out it was our Anniversary and sent up robes and slippers when we requested a coffee machine. How incredibly thoughtful! We enjoyed every moment at the Millennium and can’t imagine staying anywhere else on our next trip!,5
"It’s not my first time staying here and it won’t be my last. It’s right in Times Square, close to everything you need, a 24 hour CVS 3 min away. The room is clean and spacious. The service is amazing. Elevators are super fast. Everything was fenomenal!!",5
"The room was clean and the building is nice. Located right in the mix of Times Square and the theater district, and only a few blocks from the closest subway station, it was very easy to get anywhere we wanted to go.",5
The hotel was clean and the check in and check out process was seamless. The only thing to keep in mind is that you are basically on top of times square so if you are a light sleeper and can’t handle too much city noise this might not be for you.,5
Great location + affordable rate. Very central and near the subway so we were able to navigate around the city with ease. Lots to do in the area if you are in the mood for a touristy experience or want to see some theater! Would definitely stay again!,5
"Location is unbeatable for the price. Noise of Times Square didn’t bug us at all but it hasn’t been updated, which doesn’t matter other than the fact that there’s carpet stains, clobs of dust on the walls and grime permanently in the bathroom and corners.",5
"Very close to everything and walkable to lots of attractions. A little loud and bright due to Time Square but that’s inevitable. The only thing that was really bad - was the bed, it was like concrete! I just asked the housekeeping for three extra blankets as padding and it was somewhat doable. Other than that, the hotel staff very nice and accommodating. A couple of things had to be fixed, like the bathtub it was getting clogged. I’d stay again!",4
We have stayed at the Millennium before and we were so glad to be back. The location is convenient to everything & the staff there is always so helpful. Smooth check-in process and were always happy to store our bags. The host was always so responsive and made sure we would have a smooth process. And we did! Thank you!,5
"Great stay at the millennium broadway, we got a free upgrade to 2 double beds which was very nice the beds are so comfortable. The rooms could do with a bit of tlc in places nothing major just a bit of paint here and there. The staff are great very helpful and friendly. Great location, although times square can be a bit of ballache to navigate because it’s always so crowded, would defo stay again.",5
"The room was clean, spacious, and well-equipped, offering both comfort and a great city vibe. The bed was comfortable, but the pillows, which were too high for me. But that’s something personal. Millennium Broadway offers an ideal balance of convenience, comfort, and excellent service. Highly recommended for anyone visiting New York who wants to be at the center of it all without compromising on quality or hospitality.",5
"This was my second year staying at the Millennium Hotel. It was a wonderfully, centrally located place to stay. All the staff were kind and very helpful! I will probably book again next year! My Partner and I saw 7 shows over the course of the week. Many shows and restaurants were in walking distance! Highly recommend!",5
"We stayed 3 nights and can’t say enough about what a hidden gem we found. The hotel is right around the corner from Times Square and an easy walk to great theaters, bars, and restaurants. The building is total old school New York which was so much better than cookie cutter corporate rooms. The staff is attentive and our housekeeper was a super kind woman who always took great care of us. Highly recommend.",5
"Unfortunately, the hotel was overbooked and I didn't find this out until I was checking in. The hotel did a great job of moving me elsewhere to The Muse which is like a block away. It was frustrating in the moment, but my stay was still good. The space was clean and nice once I got in and checking out was an easy process.",4
"The hotel is located right in the heart of Times Square. Check in was a breeze, the room was exactly as described and we could walk everywhere we wanted to go. It’s located across the street from the Lyceum theatre. All the employees were friendly and the room was very quiet. It was a great place to stay!!",5
"Perfect location! The room was spacious for NYC and exactly what I needed. You’re literally near everything—Broadway, great food, and so many attractions just steps away. In only 3 days I walked over 70,000 steps, caught a show, ate and ate again, and loved every moment. The room was perfect for the price, clean and comfortable, and I’ll definitely book again the next time I’m in the city.",5
Location was perfect! 1 or 2 minute walk and you are in the middle of Times Square. We could see some of it from our room. Walgreens right next door that had everything we needed. Bed was comfortable and the room was clean. All the employees were very polite and had smiles on their faces. I didn’t get the ladies name that checked us in but she was awesome!!! Highly recommend this place.,5
"The location was incredible, check in is fine if you aren’t there early but their holding system for your stuff took forever to drop your stuff and pick it up. I’m wondering if maybe they were just short staffed this weekend because I rarely saw many hotel staff. Our room had stains on the carpet and the bathroom walls were dirty. Everything was just very worn out and dingy.",3
"Amazing stay, easy check in. Only bummed on the no water at check in but had to laugh, the guy at the counter said the tap water was drinkable in New York. Fresh paint smell as we got to the room but it went away once the air was circling. Amazing location right in the heart of Times Square and they didn’t lie about the sleepless city",5
The location was great! Easy to navigate and right in the heart of Times Square. We were out most of the day and evening and only needed the room to sleep and change. Only downside was the bathroom floor could’ve been cleaner. Had this weird stickiness to it and a slight mildew smell. I think that’s something that can be taken of fairly easily. Other than that it was a fine stay.,5
"incredible experience. great location, can exit to 44th or 45th from the building. literally steps from the heart of times square. location cant be beat. price cant be beat. had an exceptional stay with zero complaints. i will be coming back in the future for sure!",5
"Ive been a member here for quiet sometime so ill give them some slack however no mini fridge in the hotel wasn’t great we also had our shower drain clog so bath water was rising before we could get showered (they fixed right away) the first night. Also the room was so hot we had to sleep with the windows open the whole stay but again I’ve been a member for years and will continue with them I believe it was just because of the holiday being so packed we got a back up room or something. Also check the pricing in the convenient store in the hotel we believe to have over paid for some things that didn’t have prices somehow skittles, Twix bar , bottle water and two key chains were 80$ …",4
"This was the perfect place to stay for seeing lots of shows. It’s next door to two theaters with another two out the back exit. It’s close to the touristy things, but also with close access to less popular destinations.",5
"if you want to be right in the heart of Times Square for a reasonable price, this is the place. the room and bathroom was clean, and spacious enough. the check in was easy. it was busy but I only waited in line a short time. the restaurant is currently closed. but there are so many food options literally next door and across the street. I truly appreciated the luggage storage service and the bell man handling this was extremely friendly and helpful. the room did not have the superb city view like the photo but we did not mind. I did not check out the workout room. the staff were all friendly there! I would stay here again if I go back to NYC and especially to this area of Manhattan.",4
"Besides house keeping services and employees being very helpful, hotel was okay but not what was expected or worth the money. Would’ve spent more on a hotel if I had known the conditions of the rooms.",3
"Booked this for my birthday trip and it did not disappoint, loved the atmosphere, subway was super close, the view was incredible from our room. If you’re looking for something with a view and everything right in a 5-10 min walking distance book this place!!!!",5
We stayed for our Honeymoon and it was the perfect location! Within walking distance to do many attractions and restaurants! I definitely would love to stay again! Thank you!!,5
"Millennium Broadway Times Square is SUCH a great location to stay. You literally are on Times Square. Super walkable from many subways and food joints. Also super walkable for theaters. I stayed for a week and I paid a pretty good price. Next time I’m in NYC, I’m just gonna book this again!",5
"Our room was extremely clean. There was a little bit of wear and tear, but not too bad. We did have an issue with the air freshener which was very overpowering. The manager of the hotel was excellent. He found us another room right away that hadn’t been sprayed. Communication was excellent . The Italian restaurant right across the street was also wonderful and we are picky about the quality of our food , it was excellent. Overall, a good experience for New York.",5
"Must remember: hotels in NYC alone, or B&B rooms in expensive hotels, are expensive. It would help if the host highlighted all additional costs and NYC taxes, and explained what a ""hold"" is on the host's site. Jason was an outstanding and responsive host. He responded right away to my questions and made me feel he was always there. However, still do not know whether the $100.00 damage deposit ""hold"" was released.",4
"Loved the location and service; the room showed signs of age that looked like a dirty carpet but everything smelled fine and seemed clean, just kinda old. That said, we’d go back. Despite being ten steps from two theaters where we saw shows, the room was extremely quiet— a restful haven. [Know that you’ll be charged an extra $40/night upon departure per the fine print of the Air BnB contract. The price you see during the AirBnB price comparison does not mention this additional fee.",4
"Clean, safe, and convenient to NY Theaters. It was so nice to walk across the street to the theater and most other theaters only a block or so away. No taxi, uber or subway needed especially after shows. Location of the Millineum was excellent!!!!",5
Loved it and very central location! Didn’t spend much time in the room but it was pretty spacious and they always had someone on staff who helped with local recommendations:),5
"Beautiful view from the room. The hosts were responsive & front desk was accommodating. The only issue we had was that a random man did follow us up to our room, threatened to S/A us, & put a piece of tissue over our peep hole on door so we couldn’t see out. I’m not sure how he was able to get past front desk security. We end up having to switch rooms for our safety and unfortunately got downgraded as a result of that. The room we got switched to had no view, no fridge, smaller & just not as good as the first room. I do appreciate them for looking out for our safety though.",4
"The parking was perfect — there’s a garage right across from the hotel, super convenient and reasonably priced ($80 for 26 hours in Times Square!). The receptionist, Seydurah, was amazing and gave us the best first impression with her kindness and passion for music. Our room on the 31st floor had a beautiful city view, and the location was unbeatable — just around the corner from Times Square, yet still quiet at night. Overall, a wonderful experience! I’d definitely come back, especially because of the incredible staff and great energy throughout the hotel. 💛",4
We had a wonderful stay. Not a bad word to say about this place. The location was incredible and only a block away from the Stephen Sondheim theather where we watched a show. Highly recommend! 10/10,5
"I had a very good experience at the Millenium Broadway. The staff was kind and accomodating and the location perfect especially for those going to Broadway shows. The room and showers were clean and the bed comfortable. All in all, everything you'd need and want for a hotel's stay.",5
After being moved to a different room my wife and I lost out on the views of the per the Air B&B profile. Half of the outlets would not work and several unsuccessful requests of getting a refrigerator in the room that had been removed. Other than that a lovely hotel,3
What a great location right in Times Square! Lots of attractions and restaurants in walkable distance. Also very close to several subway stations. Great communication when our plane was delayed and we were arriving well into the morning after the check in time. Very good value for it's location,5
Was at this location the prior week and returned to it for my recent stay and it was such a smooth and manageable process; comfortable and accessible to my meetings and location was heart of the city,5
"I was in NY for fashion week and many of my shoots and shows were in Times Square area so the Millennium was the perfect location. Friendly employees, nice room, very clean. Would definitely stay again.",5
"loved our stay. it was right in the middle of everything and had lots of space in the room. bathroom was nice and big, which is a plus in nyc lol. check in was easy and the hotel was amazing. would stay here again :)",5
"It was easy to find the hotel and it was in a busy, central location with lots of amazing stores and restaurants. The hotel room is a bit outdated, but an amazing view from the room window to see the beautiful Time Square plaza. The employees were very kind and the check-in and check-out process was very easy. The room was cleaned daily by the kind staff and I really appreciate their attention to detail. Overall, the stay was very nice and I recommend it, especially to first timers to the city.",5
It’s a great choice for everyone who wants to get the best experience in New York! Location is perfect! Just next to Times Square! The room is beautiful. Definitely worth it!,5
"Got exactly what I need it! A nice, clean, comfortable room right in the heart of Times Square. It’s location is worth the price alone. Real close to attractions, subway stations and best of all, near really good food. Great place all around!",5
The hotel location is right on Time square. the beds were comfy and bathrooms were clean. there was a fridge but no kettle for coffees/tea. the staff were lovely and helpful at all times except when trying to drop the bag after we checked out. it seemed there was one bell boy taking an extremely long time with each bag and a qué of 20. or so. the manager wasn't receptive and simply said to wait in line. This process could have been a lot more efficient. Good stay overall.,4
"It is an older hotel. As the whole hotel smelled good, like an air freshener, our room smelled like old cigarettes. The shower was old the wallpaper was peeling and the carpet was old and dirty looking.",3
Great location and great communication from the host. The place was clean with a nice gym in the building. Only thing of note and stated by others here is that it’s a little out dated and could use a refresh. But the room was clean and staff at the hotel were all very friendly.,5
"The stay was decent overall, but there were a few issues worth noting. The room itself didn’t quite match the photos. Our room had some noticeable wear and tear that wasn’t shown in the listing. Amenities were very limited; aside from shampoo, body soap, and conditioner, there weren’t basics like cups for brushing teeth. Another downside was the lack of available power outlets, which made charging devices inconvenient. This place works if you just need a simple stay, but be aware that it falls short in comfort and amenities compared to what was advertised.",3
"Perfect location, right next to Times Square. Very good value for the money. The hotel might be a bit ”old” in the rooms, but very clean and kept in good order. For this price I highly recommend this hotel.",5
"The staff was great and the location was even better. Nice views, near everything, but not loud or bothered by the bright lights of the city.",5
"I would be giving 5 stars if it weren’t for 1 major flaw, and a few small. The heat was out in our room. It dropped to 1 degree at night. Late Saturday we had maintenance come into our room to fix it, and they informed us all the 18 and 11 rooms were with no heat do to a pipe burst a week ago. Why did they put us in a 18 room? Front desk did give us the option to switch, but it was late at night, and we only were staying 2 more nights. We didn’t want to have to pack everything up. I wish we had. Since I woke up very early Monday (checkout day) w a high fever n flu. They did give us a later checkout. So front did try to make things better. Because of this I would stay again. But our room looked nothing like the photo. We had no views. And it said a coffee machine was in every room, ours did not. We didn’t even have glasses, we had to buy our own. I had high hopes for our room based on the photos and other reviews, and nothing lived up to it. But we would stay again!",3
"The Millennium has an excellent location to spend a few nights in NYC to enjoy theater , museums and restaurants. The hotel is about 1/4 block from the greater Times Square and in the midst of the theater district. You are 3 blocks from the Times Square half priced tickets window ( tip: if you are purchase at the tickets window and are taking in another show the next 1-2 days, you can bring your ticket stub and extra an express line instead of the usual (often longer) line) and 2 blocks from the Times Square subway station ( Shuttle to GCT, trains uptown,etc.). This was our 2nd time staying at the Millennium. We were more pleased with our room last year as it offered in room coffee and a mini-fridge ( not in this year's room). There was also something a bit funky with the HVAC as the room would not heat and hold at the desired temperature. There was a very tolerable workaround, but something I'd rather not be bothered with). Net net, the Millennium offers a great location.",4
"Room needs updating. Holes in carpet, stains on wall, bathroom was gross. But not bad for price and location.",3
Location is wonderful. The cost of the hotel as well as the cleanliness and the outdated facilities not worth it! Recommend choosing the Marriott across the street.,3
"I felt as though the pictures were nothing like the room we received. We had to make sure that our room was locked at night because someone just pushed the door right open. The room was dirty and the door to the ac filter kept falling down. Upon checking in the hotel clerk was extremely rude however the manager came to make sure that after sitting for hours after we were told room would be ready (per one hotel clerk) and still wasn’t that we were able to get checked right in with no problem. The location is convenient, the baggage clerks were phenomenal, housekeeping could be better, and the little gift shop inside of hotel was great and super nice to my baby. Host did their part, some of the hotel staff just made it a little harder for me.",2
"Been my go to place when I visit the city because its affordable, clean and located in a convenient area.",5
Spacious room looked just like the picture. Great location you can walk right into Time Square. We loved our stay here.,5
"Check-in was fast and easy. The place itself clean and tidy. I didn’t see Paris too much. We’ve been messaging about who takes the bathroom first, so it was good communication. Stay was positive and good. Place is small but very clean and in good place to reach to the place sightseeing in New York. Thank you, Paris!",5
"My stay here was a welcome shelter from not only the surprise snowstorm that blew through, but also as a restive and very conveniently located spot. Paris was very proactive in messaging me, instructions were detailed and easy to follow. I come from a small town, but this stay made the stay in the city an easy transition.",5
Loved staying at Paris'. The apartment has everything you need for solo travel. Located in a really cool area in NYC and walkable to where you want to go to the city. I highly recomend for those visiting NYC. It was a wonderful place to stay.,5
Paris was a wonderful host. I appreciated her space. The location was perfect. So many subway stations close by. Lots of restaurants within 5 min walks. Great spot for the few days I was in NYC.,5
"Our stay at Paris's place was incredible. We felt right at home, it was very comfortable. Paris was a great host and very responsive. The place is located at a great location, walking distance to 3 subway stations and a couple bus stops. It's walking distance as well to Target and Trader Joe's. And there are a lot of restaurants nearby as well. It takes about 20-25 mins to get to times square area from here via subway so it's very convenient. Overall, we had an amazing stay and we'll definitely check if this place is available when we visit again.",5
"Great stay. Small (as described) but very clean and great location. Around 1 hour walk into the centre (times square) or 20 mins on the underground. Also well located for the financial district. Host was very responsive and accommodating. Good spot for doing runs along the river, and seeing lots of sites along the way. Plenty of shops and food places nearby. Would recommend and return.",5
"We had a lovely time! Everything was very clean, and the location was perfect for exploring NYC. Yes, the room was small for two people, but it was more than enough for us. Paris was very discreet and quick to respond to any questions we had. The provided guidebook was also really helpful! Would definitely recommend and stay here again 😊",5
I loved Paris’s place to stay. I stayed here 10 days and felt at home straight away. It was in such a great location that i was able to walk to most places. It was close to so much yet I slept so good every night. I had everything I needed and couldn’t fault anything. Paris really gave you space so it felt like I was almost living alone too. Thank you Paris for a great stay! Couldn’t recommend enough,5
Paris was a very kind and welcoming host. I really enjoyed the neighborhood and the food is incredible. she obviously took a lot of time to get the website up and running for checking in and all recommendations are there. she was sweet in the apartment and very non intrusive on shared spaces. do keep in mind you are sharing a restroom with her so there may be times you need to use the bathroom and it's occupied or vice versa. this only happened to me once in three days though and it's absolutely okay especially considering the value of the location you are receiving in New York city. I'd absolutely visit again and appreciate all the free amenities with free earplugs toothbrush and shampoo conditioner and body wash. thanks again!,5
"Can’t beat the location in the LES. Clean and comfy place. Paris is a wonderful host. We only met once when I was arriving, but she provided me with everything I needed and was always responsive.",5
Nice and clean apartment in a trendy and lively neighbourhood; Paris was an excellent host,5
"Paris was great! She provided me with a guide that had all the steps and answers to questions I had not even imagined. She was very accommodating and help me storing my luggage before check in. The place is small, as shown in pictures but my husband and I were able to fit perfectly, and honestly when in NYC you just go to sleep to the Airbnb so it was not a biggy. I would absolutely stay again at Paris place. Also, it is 10 minutes walking from china town and little Italy so very very walkable and tons of things to do, subway was 3 minutes walking and it was very quiet at night. One flight of stairs but not steep",5
"A perfect place to stay if you want to explore NYC! The apartment itself was lovely - really pretty and really clean and tidy. Paris was lovely to stay with too! The flat was is a perfect location to get out and about, with a couple of subway stations in walking distance. The neighbourhood itself is lovely too with plenty of places to see. I had a fantastic time here and would highly recommend",5
"We had a really nice stay at Paris. The apartment is very tiny but clean and cozy and the location is super central. Paris was friendly and even though sharing the apartment, we felt like we had our privacy at all times. Even though it is central, it was quieter than we expected. We had a good time! :)",5
"I enjoyed staying at Paris’s apartment. It was so clean, styled very nicely, and in a perfect location. This is prime in NYC - I would not hesitate to book. I lived in New York for 10 years and it’s hard to come across homes like Paris’s. She was a great communicator and gave straight forward instructions prior to booking. Effortless check in and the hosts accommodations went above and beyond. Would certainly stay here again!",5
Great location and clean place. Paris was kind and responsive. I’d stay here again,5
"I booked this stay because the host stated she was living alone, but during the stay an unannounced adult man stayed overnight in the home. I was traveling with a minor, and this was never disclosed before arrival. This completely changed the safety and privacy conditions of the stay. In addition, the bedroom contained industrial dehumidifiers running constantly, which clearly indicates a pre-existing humidity or air quality problem that was not disclosed in the listing. These are not normal household devices and their presence suggests an ongoing issue with ventilation or moisture. I believe future guests should be aware that the actual living conditions differ from what is described in the listing, especially for anyone traveling with children or expecting a private and transparent shared-home arrangement.",1
"Great place, great location. Comfortable, and perfectly positioned to explore the city. Paris made checking in easy and was very responsive",5
"Loved my stay. The home was clean and in a decent area with close access to a lot of public transit and amazing restaurants and shopping. hallways are small and a little creepy, but still felt safe coming in late.",5
"Comfortable quiet room, courteous host, room was as described. Has everything you need. Great location close to 2 trains making very accessible to rest of town. Proximity to a lot of restaurants. Highly recommend!",5
"The room is tiny, but you’ll find all the necessary stuff inside the apartment. It’s well located—around a 5-minute walk from the subway. Overall, it’s really good value for the money",5
"I was coming down from upstate for the night and I needed a home base. I love the neighborhood, and Paris’s place was super comfortable and quiet. A wonderful, safe, comfortable spot!",5
"Great place to stay, it is small and compact but it was perfect for me and my boyfriend. Lovely places near by, walkable cafe’s and bars. I would recommend to stay around the area.",5
"This was a perfect hub for my quick jaunt in the city. I loved how close the train was to the apartment. The space is immaculate full of little thoughtful details and free of clutter. It’s a cozy space but really well organized. It’s perfect for a solo traveler. I loved how welcoming Paris was, leaving clear instructions and warm welcome. The space felt private! The bed was so comfy! Also check out the speakeasy across the street “attaboy” - thanks Paris!!",5
"Great place to stay when visiting NYC! Close to some restaurants and a nice quiet neighborhood. We felt safe even late at night. Maia is friendly and so is Shabba (the cat)!! Always came to greet us before bed. The room is very small and tight for two people, but it was totally fine for us, and the bed was very comfortable. Thanks for the great stay and for helping make our trip magical!",5
"Great stay in the East Village! Although it’s just a bedroom, it was very comfortable, clean, and exactly what we needed. The space felt cozy and well taken care of. As a bonus, there’s a sweet cat (Shabba) who made our stay even more enjoyable. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a simple, comfortable place in a great location.",5
"We had a lovely time! Shabba was an adorable addition to our stay, and we received lots of cuddles from him. The location was great for our needs and the space was welcoming and clean.",5
"It is well located in a quiet residential neighborhood, yet just a short walk from restaurants and shops. The apartment overall is comfortable - as described on the listing and photos. Love the kitchen and common area, where a lovely cat would greet you. It is a great place to stay in Manhattan.",5
"Loved our stay here!! Perfect location in East Village in Manhattan - close to a ton of great restaurants and easy access to the rest of NYC. The place itself was cozy, very clean, and really felt like a home away from home. The host was welcoming and kind, instructions for checkin and checkout were a breeze, and our interactions during our stay felt very comfortable. Ofc, have to give a shoutout to Shabba who was the cutest cat!! We loved being greeted by our fluffy host :D Would definitely recommend this stay!",5
"Maia, her mother and Shabba the cat were all great! Her apt was lovely, I was in and out of their place comfortably and had everything I needed for a quick stay 10/10 would stay again!",5
"My friend & I had a wonderful stay! We loved the neighborhood & enjoyed walking & exploring the area. The bed was one of the comfiest I have come across. Maia, her mom, and her wonderful cat were all so friendly & kind!",5
We loved our stay! The place was super clean and smelled so nice. The cat was absolutely adorable and made the whole place feel even cozier. The coffee machine was great too. Thank you for hosting us!,5
"I had a great stay! From the moment I checked in, Shabba the cat greeted me and made the experience feel extra warm and homey. Maia was an amazing host- very nice, quick to respond, and always helpful with any questions I had. The space itself was cozy, spotless, and exactly as described. I felt comfortable the entire time. Highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a welcoming and relaxing stay!",5
"10 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · November 2025 Maia’s place is a cute little accommodation in East manhattan. It’s well located and is walking distance to nice restaurants and bars. Maia and her mom were helpful and accommodating hosts. The room is a bit small but super comfortable (but that’s what living in Manhattan in about) and Maia had kept all the amenities. Shabba, her cat, is also super cute and we had a great time!! Will surely book this again",5
"Maia was very responsive and gave clear instructions for my late arrival. Maia's mother was very friendly and engaging. Had a wonderful conversation as both of us work in the Wellness field. Shabba is the sweetest cat--don't tell my cat, but I would trade him for Shabba any day. Shhhh! Lovely, lovely experience overall. Would book here again!",5
"Maia was a great host! She was extremely welcoming and accommodating, we felt right at home. Shabba the cat greeted us right when we got in. He was so friendly and hung out with us throughout the stay!",5
Great place to stay in the East Village area. Good location for moving around South Manhattan. We basically used Maia's place for showering and sleeping. A very safe neighborhood.,5
"Maia was an awesome host - I was only in town for a night after a work event. I came in pretty late and didn't get to chat much, but Maia and her sweet cat, Shabba, greeted me and made sure I was comfortable. It was the perfect stay for a quick night in the city.",5
"I was traveling with my friend, we felt perfectly safe and well accommodated in the apartment. It was well connected with the bis and subway to any spot in NYC. Kitchen is perfect for a nice dinner at home. Amazing place !! 😍",5
"8 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · September 2025 Maia’s apartment was the perfect place for us for a short stay in NYC, we will definitely miss Shabba very much. He welcomed us the minute we set foot in the house. Highly recommend.",5
"We had a nice stay at Maia's place. There's a private room to yourself but shared living area with Maia and Shabba (the cute cat). The space is well decorated and the bathroom is super spacious; the amenities were also a plus! Overall, a good place to stay for a solo traveler or a couple. The location is great, the street itself is quiet but just nearby are plenty of restaurants, cafes, and bars that are open late.",4
"We loved stay with Maia! She was lovely. She was very accommodating with our early check-in request. The condo was clean, quiet and we felt safe. The area is very walkable to a nice park, good food, and close to bus stops and subway stations. After a long day of exploring the city, it was nice coming back to the condo and relaxing.",5
"Maia's apartment was a fantastic place to stay in Alphabet City. Close enough to the subway, Citi Bike stations, and the East Village - everything I needed was at my finger tips. I also appreciated how proactive Maia was about an electrical issue that popped up during my stay. I loved recuperating in the cozy space, and her hospitality was fantastic. I would absolutely stay here again!",5
This was a perfect stay for us! All we needed was a comfortable bed and a hot shower at the end of each of 2 long days in the city. We got the bonus of Shabba the cat who was stellar in every way! We were missing our dog back home so Shabba filled the void in the mornings before we headed out and again in the evenings after a long day exploring and having a blast. I would 💯 stay here again!,5
Loved staying here! Thank you for making our NYC trip comfortable and homey. Shabba was a true king and helped us feel better while missing our own kitties.,5
Had a wonderful stay. Maia and her mom were incredibly friendly and helpful. Shabba was a wonderful company during the stay.,5
"Maia was an excellent and responsive host. The AirBnB was well decorated and clean, and had plenty of amenities. Her cat Shabba was also one of the friendliest cats I’ve ever met.",5
"If You’re looking for an airbnb in NYC don’t Look further. Maia‘s AirBnB is very stylish, clean and cozy. We felt comfortable from the very first beginning. Would love to come again. Thank you!",5
"I had a lovely stay at 17 John Hotel in the Financial District. Check-in was smooth and quick, and the front desk staff was great and very welcoming. My room was very clean and fully stocked with everything I needed for a comfortable stay. Overall, great room, great staff, and great communication. I would definitely stay here again!",5
"We had an excellent stay at 17 John’s. The room was noticeably more spacious than most in the area, very reasonably priced, and perfectly located. We were within easy walking distance of many must-see spots and just steps from the subway, which made getting around effortless. We wouldn’t hesitate to book here again.",5
"The place looked exactly as it was described and was shown in the photos. Very spacious for NYC. It's in the financial district, so it's not as busy on the streets at night and isn't packed with tourist spots. Very walkable and close to subway. Host was super friendly and responsive. Unit was clean and comfortable.",5
"I had a wonderful stay at 17 John. The location is unbeatable, the room was clean and comfortable, and the staff were consistently helpful, responsive, and friendly throughout my visit. Check-in was smooth, the building felt secure, and everything was exactly as described. I truly appreciated the professionalism and hospitality. Highly recommended, and I’d be happy to stay here again on my next trip to New York.",5
"I had a phenomenal stay at 17 John Hotel, it is located in a extremely walkable area. Everything was nearby, the place was as described, and I couldn’t have asked for a better stay.",5
"This space was perfect for my week of meetings. Great location, close to the subway, good cafes and eateries around. The apartment itself is designed very well and feels spacious especially for New York. 10/10 would recommend!",5
this really was a perfect place to stay for me in the city. i was attending a conference in times square area but didn’t want to stay there. wanted more of the charm of battery city. access to the subway is so easy and convenient that it made staying out of the immediate area easy and convenient. the apartment was clean and well stocked in the kitchen and bathroom. the host and team were responsive throughout the stay. really great stay! thank you!,5
This place was perfect! It was incredibly clean and comfortable. The host was also super. responsive which I really appreciated. I would definitely recommend staying here!,5
"We had a great stay at the 17 John Street property. The location is a huge highlight since it is just steps away from multiple subway lines, which made getting around NYC incredibly easy. The apartment itself was very clean and well maintained. The shower was excellent (important detail after long days of walking exploring the city!), and having laundry unit on the floor was extremely convenient, especially while traveling with a child. Overall, a comfortable, well-located, and thoughtfully equipped place. I would definitely stay here again.",5
We had a great stay here! Beautiful place with lots of space and everything you could need. The staff was on top of communication and responded quickly if we had any questions. Awesome host and we’ll definitely come back in the future!,5
Very nice room and hotel. The team and host are always very helpful and responsive. Really recommend to stay here it’s also right on a big subway station so very easy to get around,5
"This place was so amazing!!! I would stay here over and over again. The first big plus was the security at the front door and for the unit itself. The views are amazing, this place was a great home during my stay.",5
17 John St. was a perfect place to stay in New York City. Close to the subway close to restaurants close to shopping. The space was immaculate and very well laid out. We will be coming back to 17 John St. again.,5
Hotel is in a good location in lower manhattan. We walked to ground zero and to a Brooklyn bridge view easily. Everything was clean. Self service laundry was great. Host was communicative and responsive.,5
"Centrally located, lots of subway access, spacious room, plenty of amenities, sleek design. Quiet even in the middle of the hustle and bustle of the city. Will definitely stay again!",5
we absolutely loved our stay! very close to the subways for transportation! we loved this studio apartment it was beautiful and had everything we needed! if we had any questions responses were quick! would stay here again!,5
"Room was as described. Close to multiple subway entrances, so super convenient for going up or downtown. Also close to Apollo bagels, which was very nice. The heating situation was quite odd. There was no thermostat control for the main space, and the heater was quite loud to not have any control of the system. Bathroom thermostat had a dying/dead battery; we asked maintenance to replace but no one fixed it, and the heater in the bathroom stopped working at one point.",4
"Great place to stay, private entrance with reception, surprisingly spacious apartment. Subway system is right on the corder, great bagle and coffee place right across the street, CVS and Wholefoods very close by. You leave in the heart of financial district.",5
"Our recent stay at 17John was exceptional! Location - great for exploring the Financial District, SOHO, Tribeca, the West Village and more Unit- Looks just like the photos posted online. Spacious (NYC standards), clean, no clutter yet had everything we needed. Communication- outstanding! Proactive and quick to respond. We will 100% be returning to 17 John for our next stay. Thank you",5
"We booked a huge studio apartment with the amenities. It had everything in it. Good air conditioning also and windows were sound proof which makes it helpful with endless nyc construction situation. Overall, impressive size for New York, it might have been the biggest place I’ve ever stayed in my lifetime",5
"I have to say I was not expecting a hotel when booking said Airbnb. As it stated it was an apartment, but all in all the setting, cleanliness, communication, and environment is well established. From decor to lighting, the aesthetic is timeless. If I had to stay at a hotel it would be 17 John’s Hotel. Thank you James and Tatiana at the front desk for your thorough communication and support.",5
"9 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · September 2025 I had a great stay at 17 John and I am now very fond of the Tribeca region of NYC as a result. The hotel was beautifully set up, superbly located and fun to stay at. The online communication channel ran smoothly and the front desk friendly and helpful. As they say in the classifieds, I’m givi 17 John five stars!",5
"We had a great stay at 17 John. I read some of the previous negative reviews, and am glad I disregarded it bc the apartment was exactly like the pics, a/c worked fine, and there were no issues whatsoever. Staff was great, almost as soon as we asked for something (new hairdryer, extra garbage bags etc) it appeared at our door. Wife & I would def stay here again.",5
17 John’s is a modern and well located place to stay at. This location is better than most of the hotel offering around. I was able to get to the hot spots in NYC and subway with ease! The room was clutter free and with lots of space. The restroom was of excellen size as well. Lobby hosts were friendly and always felt safe.,5
"Overall, this place was amazing! It was my first time flying, yet alone traveling by myself. And Casey made it feel like a breeze. There were lots of pots, pans, and silverware that allowed for an easy crafting of breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I was confused on how to enter the building, but he responded right away as I arrived and assisted me with getting in. I would definitely vacation here again.",5
You know it’s so lovely to feel comfortable as soon as you walk into a room. There was water and cute work desk and internet. Lots of pillows and a comfy bed. Even a noise machine to block out ambience. Actually though it was not a noisy place. It was a superb artfully furnished apartment. What you’d expect when you get to know Casey who is a talented artist. Thanks Casey for making my visit easeful and accommodating.,5
"This place was perfect for what I needed! Great location. Within walking distance to the shops in soho and all the most popular restaurants. Also close to little Italy and China town. All the popular night life options are nearby as well. Close to NYU so the crowd around this part of town is younger. As a female who was traveling alone, the apartment felt very safe. Comfortable/quiet place to sleep. Casey was very helpful and kind.",5
Had a great stay here while I was waiting to move in somewhere more long term :) Both Casey and his roommate Austin were friendly and responsive/helpful. Room is clean and the apartment is located in one of the best neighbourhoods in the city. Very walkable + lots to see do and eat in the area.,5
"I had a wonderful stay in this beautiful East Manhattan apartment! The place was clean, bright, and comfortable — exactly as described. Casey was friendly, helpful, and made check-in very easy. The apartment’s location is perfect, close to great restaurants, cafés, and cultural spots, yet quiet enough to rest after a busy day in the city. I really enjoyed my time here and would definitely stay again. Highly recommended!",5
"I felt right at home the moment I walked in. Casey is friendly and hospitable. The check-in instructions were thorough and helped me easily locate and access the space. The room was cozy and I appreciated all the art. Plenty of fans in the room, I slept great. I loved the neighborhood and how close it was to so much to do. Easy walk from the train with luggage. I just booked my second visit for next month.",5
"The place is in a great neighbourhood with a lot of good independent breakfast spots around. The bed was very comfortable but the I room I was in was windowless and small and not really a proper room in the flat but an addition. Having said that - the living room and kitchen spaces are lovely but, to be honest, I wasn’t really made to feel at home by the host person present when I arrived. I think this is a must as we are entering their home and need that feeling of being welcome and valued as people. Thus is core in hospitality which is the business that airbnb hosts are in. Also the signing and use of amenities instructions etc seem to give a vibe that guests were a bit of a nuisance…",4
"This was my second time staying here, and loved it again. Casey is beyond accommodating. This time of year was colder than before but the bedroom was still nice and cozy. Amazing host, perfect spot, I will be back every time I’m in town.",5
I really had a good time and Casey’s home was a perfect spot to explore the city. A home away from home. The bed was comfy and the apartment cosy. Would highly recommend.,5
"This was a great location within the East Village, walkable to many coffee shops, restaurants and nightlife. Casey was friendly and the space was welcoming, with a clean and comfortable room. I absolutely enjoyed my stay, and would book again the next time I’m in town!",5
"Fantastic experience staying at Caseys space. Everything was clear and as described. Location was top notch, central to everything I need to get to. Apt was very charming and tastefully laid out. Overall very satisfied with my stay and experience.",5
"Casey was a great host, and the room was well-worth the price. The apartment was clean and well-kept, and the neighborhood is full of possibilities for nightlife, food, and entertainment!",5
"Casey is the best host, period. And this is the best place to stay. There are tons of restaurant nearby and the metro is 5 mins walk. Most importantly, this is the best place to take aesthetic pictures inside and also on the rooftop. Highly highly recommend.",5
had an amazing time and that was based on how convenient Casey's is to everything and how safe and comfortable I was. the East Village has everything you need!,5
"Great typical Alphabet City place. Only one flight walk up. There are three bedrooms with multiple people checking in and out but a least one host was always on site. Rooms and apartment clean. Felt at home. Other guests were great. Neighborhood was excellent. Loved the Book Bar, Pig and Butter and other restaurants. My room didn’t have a window to outside the apartment but I didn’t mind because the room was comfortable.",4
"Pros: Great location in east village, very comfortable bed. Cozy room. Safe. Casey accommodated me last minute. Cons: check in difficult, Casey's roommate not very welcoming, no a/c (room had no window to outside) and should definitely be disclosed in the listing. The second day Casey did get a/c but was in kitchen not bedroom.",3
"Casey was an amazing host, as was his roommate Austin. Both were kind and fun. You can enjoy both privacy and great conversations if you're open to it. The neighborhood, as always, was spectacular. Every time I visit NYC, East Village is my go-to—close to everything with an amazing nightlife. This stay was special and fun. Thank you both!",5
"I enjoyed my stay at Casey's place. The bedroom was clean and comfortable. I didn't use the kitchen or living room, but they appeared to be very clean and well appointed. The location was very good for me. I like the East Village, and the F train is close by. I met both Casey and his roommate and they were very nice. I would definitely return if the opportunity came up.",5
Unfortunately I was unable to stay due to some crazy delays and getting stuck in Brooklyn that day. I look forward to trying again one day,5
"Casey is a very nice guy and was nice to chat with during my stay. His apartment felt like quintessential NYC with good art, wood floors, and exposed brick walls.",5
"I highly recommend this place for a stay in NYC! It has a very cute vibe, it is perfectly located, lovely set up and great host!",5
"Getting into the building was a challenge as the intercom did not work and I was given the incorrect code for the lock that contained the keys to open the apartment door. Had to wait 20 minutes for someone to come down. The room/apartment was fine, just not as bright as shown in the listing pictures, which was what made it look attractive. I didn’t end up staying due to personal reasons, so the rating is based on what I experienced till the time I left. 3.5/5",3
The location is superb if you just want to hang out in Greenwich or East village which in my view is the best neighborhood in New York. Casey gave very detailed instructions so my check-in was pretty smooth. I really enjoyed my five nights here.,5
"Location is great, the apartment is amazing, really liked the art works, also has a very nice vibe, very homey and cool! Room is a perfect size, slept really well, have not experienced any noise at all. Highly recommend staying at Casey's. Overall, had an amazing time in NYC.",5
"Allison was such an incredible host !!! I’m so excited to book with her again and enjoy the surrounding areas once more ! The home was super cozy, bed was extremely comfortable, and overall Allison made me feel right at home ! Which is always important to me when traveling! If I could give 10 stars I would!! Excited to come back!!",5
"I was grateful for Allison's room in a great location for a night in the city. She made it easy for me with her flexibility and welcoming nature. The bed was comfortable and though the bathroom is the tiniest I've ever seen, the water was hot and all was clean. The bonus was her incredibly friendly dog. I'd stay here again.",5
"8 years on Airbnb Rating, 3 stars , · December 2025 Allison very kindly stored my luggage for a few hours after check-out, which was a great help in NYC. Unfortunately, the room wasn’t made up and the bed wasn’t made by the time I checked in late at night. The lockbox was not easy to find and was buried beneath trash and Allison wasn’t home to assist.",3
"I loved my stay at Allison's.! The space is clean, cozy and an excellent location. Super close to the Q, and buses. I was able to walk to Madison Ave, Central Park and Roosevelt Island. Allison is a gem and went out of her way to be generous and hospitable during my stay so sweet!! I would be happy to stay again.",5
"Allison’s apartment is super cozy and perfect for my short trip to nyc! She was a kind host and the room is a good size. The surrounding neighborhood is great, in walking distance to tons of museums and restaurants",5
"This was a fantastic experience from start to finish! Allison’s apartment is very welcoming and relaxed and she was tremendously accommodating - the whole place has a great overall vibe. Extremely comfortable room with great natural light. Super sweet dog! I would stay here again in a heartbeat. Neighborhood is also brilliant for restaurants and the apartment is perfectly situated - central but also on a nice quiet street. Five stars plus without hesitation, highly recommend!",5
"Allison was an excellent host! The apartment was very comfortable, clean and located very close to the end of the Q line which made traveling the city a breeze. Can’t recommend staying with Allison and Matilda enough, they were perfectly accommodating, helpful and flexible.",5
"Allison's place was perfect! Felt extremelyy safe in the neighborhood and everything was very walkable! Was also able to have a straight walk through to Central Park and loved that there was a Whole Foods, Pura Vida, and cvs very nearby! I also appreciated that I was able to drop my luggage off in the early afternoon once I arrived to the city so I could explore the city during the day! Instructions were also made super clear and she was very responsive and made my trip such a breeze! 😊 also had such a sweet and adorable puppy! 🐶",5
"Allison was a fantastic host, and her place was wonderful to stay at! The room was very comfortable and cozy, and Allison made every part of the booking and stay simple and easy. Also, it was a great jumping off point for everything I was doing on the city. I would highly recommend staying here!",5
"Allison was great! Very responsive, fun to chat with and made sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed. She welcomed us into her home as if it was our home. The room was cozy with big windows facing out onto the street. The neighborhood was easy to navigate, convenient to the metro and walkable to lots of places. Matilda, her sweet dog, was a bonus! Allison and Matilda were perfect hosts for our short stay. We would definitely stay here again! Highly recommended!",5
I loved my short stay at Allison's place. I really appreciate how flexible she was with letting me check in and I would definitely stay with her again and would recommend her place.,5
"Second time at this place, and it still didn’t disappoint! Check-in went smoothly and Allison was always responsive. I would highly recommend this place, especially if you want to be in the UES area.",5
"Everything about the stay at Allison's apartment was perfect! Ultra comfortable and 100% feel-at-home, which is so important in shared environments! I can't think of any way it could have been better! AND, it is what Airbnb should be - the ability for someone with a home with some extra space to make some extra money, while NOT taking any needed housing out of the pool! Allison (and Matilda!) were perfect hosts and made sure I was comfortable and had what I needed every step of the stay! Highly, HIGHLY recommended!",5
"Had a wonderful stay with Allison and Matilda :) such a warm welcoming to NYC. I would definitely stay there again, the appartment was super cozy and Allison was a great host! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",5
Had a great stay at Allison’s and would stay again. She’s very friendly and it’s perfect if you’re just looking for a place to crash at the end of the day and don’t want to spend on extra luxuries.,5
"I had a great experience staying with Alison. If you are looking for a hotel like experience, this isn't the place for you. This is like one of your friends is letting you stay at their place as a guest - which is exactly what I wanted. Her dog is so sweet, and my bedroom was roomy and clean. I would definitely stay here again.",5
"Allison is a fantastic host! Super friendly and accommodating and Miss Matilda (her pup) is a doll! The room is just as listed, bed was very comfortable and we had everything we needed for a quick 48 hours in NYC. Location is fantastic with so much within walking distance, and even very close to Central Park. Subway is close by as well for exploring different areas of Manhattan. Thank you Allison for everything! Highly recommend staying here!",5
"I stayed at Allison's place for one night and I really recommend it for anyone wanting to stay in the Upper East budget at a very reasonable price. Allison is really nice and was also able to accomodate a flexible check in when I told her I was travelling on my own and would have needed to carry my bags around for the day otherwise. The room is as described and has fresh towels available for guests. Allison's dog was a lovely addition to my stay as she is very friendly and cuddly. The place is really quiet and the area is very safe, at a walkable distance from Central Park. Will definitely stay here again next time I am in NYC!",5
"Allison’s place is on the UES of Manhattan— it’s extremely walkable, there are tons of restaurants nearby, and it’s easy to find parking nearby. Allison, herself, is very friendly and she was flexible on check-in. I’d stay again for sure.",5
"Allison was great! Super accommodating for my very late check-in. instructions to enter were very clear since their were several steps to get into the building, but photos and videos with written instructions were very helpful. Room was super cozy and just what I needed. Matilda (wonderful dog) kept me company in the morning. The neighborhood was easy to navigate, nice to be in, and very convenient to metro and walkable areas. would definitely stay again. Allison also had wonderful recommendations and was very helpful!",5
"Alison’s place was great! If you’re nervous about sharing a home with someone, I believe Alison is the perfect person to share with. She was very kind and her sweet dog Matilda was lovely. Alison was very proactive in making sure our stay was comfortable. I wouldn’t recommend this stay for someone who has trouble climbing stairs, or is a minimalist as this home is very much lived in (honestly my favorite part though because it felt like we lived in nyc!). I would 100% choose this home again for our next trip to New York!",5
Loved my stay with Allison! Area where I stayed was super quiet and she was always very helpful. Even with my last minute luggage drop off she made it possible. Would definitely stay here again :),5
"Allison was a responsive and accommodating host, and the room was a clean and quiet space to retreat after the day’s activities, located in a convenient neighborhood, close to transportation and well situated for visiting museums and restaurants.",4
"Allison is a great host, she’s responsive and helpful. She was flexible when I had to store my luggage and came in a little later than originally planned. The room is spacious and has big windows. Overall I enjoyed my stay and the location can’t be beat!",5
"7 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · December 2025 Jalina’s apartment was very nice and the Christmas decorations made it even more beautiful .😍 Clean and comfortable place and felt like spending more time there. She is proactive and helpful in her response with questions we had.",5
"The place was very nice, clean, super comfortable beds, free coffee and some food and ingredients to cook, I enjoyed my stay there, the only 2 situations that I had is that the walls are very thin so you can hear all of your neighbors noise, the public transportation is good from de place with Apple Pay very easy, the only problem is that you have to buy an actual ticket from the station, you can’t pay it directly in the bus and with traffic it can take you like an hour to get there, so take your time. Overall the experience was good and comfortable.",5
"It was a last-minute find but 100% a gem we were going to New York City and we needed a place close by and this definitely matched that description, just like photos and is very clean and neat and organized the toilet does have a bit of a hard time flushing. You have to hold it down, but that’s OK. The host responded very quickly even when I messaged at two in the morning this is definitely a great place. I definitely recommend. Just make sure to pay for a spot with your reservation because there is no street parking at all.",5
"We had a wonderful stay at Jalina’s place in New Jersey! The apartment was spotless, very organized, and had all the kitchen utensils and essentials we needed. The room and the apartment were both spacious and comfortable. Communication with Jalina was excellent, she was always quick to respond and very kind. The location is also super convenient, with three different bus options to get to NYC easily. Highly recommend!",5
"The place was comfortable, clean and well organized . It had everything we needed for a pleasant stay.",5
Had a great two nights here! My family and I needed somewhere to rest our heads for a quick weekend trip to New Jersey/ New York City. It was affordable and very clean. Great place to stay if you’re visiting the area with lots of plans like my family. Jalina was quick to respond which made traveling easy and stress free. Thanks again to Jalina!,5
"Great host, very accommodating. Great communication. You have to share bathroom with up to 4 other people aside from your own group which is only challenging if you have to only use the toilet and somewhere is showering. but this is all communicated ahead of time so no fault of owner at all! Few places in walking distance to grab something to eat including Dunkin and 711. Otherwise very good experience.",5
"this was my first time using airbnb so i had obviously heard all types of stories from amazing to awful but Lina was AMAZING!! above all else, she was super responsive and helpful. the place was clean and her expectations were very clear. it was a shared spaces with others but the way Lina operated, it never felt like we were in each other’s way or anything! i’ll def continue to use airbnb and hopefully will use lina in the future",5
"We really liked the place!! Friendly neighborhood, bus stops are close. Very clean apartment with instructions that helps you to find everything. Lina was very helpful even at midnight with the check in!",5
"Kinda worth it!!!! It’s cool that u can take the bus 154 to the nyc and there are also convenient store and dunkin that u can take if u need. Very convenient even thought it is kindly far from NYC, but still can reach to that easily.",5
"Our stay at Lina’s was really great ! The place is comfortable, welcoming and very clean with multiple equipments. We arrived by bus so we had to face a slope which was a bit steep, but overall everything was nice !",5
"Overall great place to stay, and much more affordable than Manhattan etc. Easy to get into the city, there’s a bus that takes around half an hour. Everything was very clean and the descriptions were accurate. Lina was a friendly and responsive host, communication went great. The only thing that can be difficult is sharing a bathroom with the other room, but since we knew that in advance, that is not something that would affect how satisfied we were with the place in general. Thanks for having us!",5
"Stayed for one night to go to the Yankees game and this was the perfect place, couldn’t have asked for anything better for what we needed it was spotless, clean, easy access to NYC, will absolutely be staying again next time.",5
"I recently stayed at this Airbnb and had an amazing experience! The host was incredibly responsive and friendly, making communication seamless from start to finish. They went above and beyond to ensure we had everything we needed, which made the trip even more enjoyable. The house itself was spotless, which we truly appreciated. It was clear that cleanliness was a priority, and it made us feel completely at ease. Everything we could possibly need was provided, from kitchen essentials to extra blankets, making it feel like a home away from home. Overall, this stay exceeded our expectations, and I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a clean, well-equipped home with a fantastic host!",5
"Impeccable apartment in terms of cleanliness and organization, bedroom with comfortable bedding and good size for us who went as 2 adults and 1 child, kitchen with all the necessary utensils and large bathroom. Close to the bus stops that go to Manhattan (154 is a 4-minute walk and 156/159 is a 9-minute walk). Very polite and agile host to answer questions and guide us. I recommend it!! Translated from Portuguese Show original",5
Could not be happier!! Such amazing value for what you are getting!!!,5

It was an amazing stay. The accommodation was so clean and organized. I’d love to stay here again.,5
Clean place. Travel to NY by Bus takes time. Use 3 route instead of 1 then better option. Overall is Good,4
Great host,5
"A nice space for a short period of time. Nice that there is a general area with cooking facilities. Sharing the bathroom is fine, it just takes time. If you take that into account, that's also easy to do. Quiet area, Manhattan 25 min travel distance. Return trip in the evening, please note the last departure times and routes. Room in perfect order. General area and bathroom kept clean. Translated from Dutch Show original",4
Beautiful place would book again if I ever visit New York,5
"This was a great place. I went solo but you can have multiple people stay in the room. Easy to get to the 154 to New York! If you need a place for NYC, come to Jersey",5
"One of the most beautiful accommodations I've ever had the opportunity to visit! Luxurious, beautifully furnished, with good access to NYC. Even the local neighborhood offered a range of options for great dining or shopping. I definitely recommend it! Translated from Czech Show original",5
"Host was very proactive and always checking in! We slept great! the place was clean. each room has its own pin pad to get in! The only downfall would be the people in other rooms and maybe sharing the bathroom, but that should be expected if you’re only getting one room. Over all, I had an amazing time, and I would definitely come again!",3
"A very cozy house, I would definitely stay again in this very nice place and it matches the photos Translated from Spanish Show original",5
"We had a great stay at this Airbnb in New Jersey during our trip to New York! The apartment was clean, comfortable and perfectly located with easy access to the city - both by car and public transport.

Can definitely be recommended to others who want to experience New York, but would like to stay a little quieter and more relaxed. Translated from Danish Show original",5
"Great place, had everything we needed!",5
"I love this place, I'll start with the place, beautiful, super organized, and it has everything, everything as if you were at home, very cozy, I love the room since it has a closet, mirror, super comfortable beds, I could describe everything as perfect about this place.

"It’s was comfortable, easy going. Everything was perfect. Hope to come back again as I’m always in New Jersey. Thank you for everything",5
"Our stay was excellent! The room and apartment were as we saw in the publication. Everything was very clean and organized. Despite having a shared bathroom with other guests, we never had any problems and had a pleasant time. The location of the apartment is good because you can take a bus route that passes two blocks away and leaves you at Port Authority and from there you can move around New York by subway. Lina was nice and always attentive to my questions and helped me a lot with the transportation issue. I recommend this accommodation 100%. The only recommendation is that at the end of our stay it was already very hot in the city and we had no way to turn off the heating or turn on the air conditioning. Everything else is excellent! Translated from Spanish Show original",5
"I really liked it, very comfortable, clean and conveniently located accommodation. A bus dropped us off in New York and it was very easy to get around. Would stay there again! Translated from Spanish Show original",5
It's a great place to stay! We'd come back. Translated from Spanish Show original,5

Good saving options if you’re looking for affordable and clean place to stay in Jersey!,5
The house is very nice and very clean,5
"Great place, everything we hoped for. It was our first time traveling to the east coast. We wanted a bigger place than a hotel room and Jesus’s place was perfect. We’re not used to public transportation but it was great that this place was a block or 2 from the bus stop to NY. Booking this place also gave us an opportunity to explore NJ. Will definitely book again 💖",5
"Jesus was a wonderful host! We loved our stay here. It was clean, filled with all the necessities and there was constant communication which helped a lot during our stay. This place is a bus away from NYC and the location of this Airbnb is very safe and close to great food shops. Lastly I’d like to mention, during our stay there was a snowstorm and Jesus was so helpful in directing us how to prepare and was able to accommodate us, which we were very thankful for. Thank you again! Definitely recommend.",5
"Jesus and Karina were excellent hosts, when we got there she called me and gave clear instructions on how to get into the garage and met us there to provide the keys and remote as well. They were extremely responsive and very prompt, very nice and friendly. There home was beautiful very clean. I Loved the space and this was my first Airbnb in New Jersey and set the tone for when we get our own place. I recommend anyone looking for beautiful views of the city and close access to New York to stay here. It’s awesome and very cozy. Thank you Jesus and Karina!",5
"Great place to stay outside the crowded and small spaces in NYC, getting to the city was easy via the 128/166 bus. The apartment is spacious, well illuminated and it has everything you need, you'll feel at home for sure. Jesus and Karina are great hosts, very attentive to any question that you have, they reply pretty quick!",5
"We had a great stay! The host was always responsive and very helpful throughout our visit. There was an issue with a loud noise during our stay, but the host was extremely diligent in offering solutions and making sure we were comfortable. It wasn’t anything that ruined our experience, we still enjoyed our time very much. Overall, great communication and hospitality!",5
I loved this Airbnb! It was clean and had everything we needed. There is a full kitchen so I was able to make myself food when it was too late to dine out. He has a washer and dryer in unit in case you need to wash your clothes. He was so responsive and helpful. He also has the option to park in a garage which was super helpful in New Jersey as parking can be a problem.,5
"I enjoyed the stay at Jesus’ place, it was easy to find and walkable to what I needed. It was quiet at night and also I liked that it was a short UBER to MetLife stadium (about 20 minutes). Great selection of place if you want proximity to NYC and NJ equally without being in the hustle and bustle.",5
"We had a great stay at this apartment. Everything was clean, well-organized, and exactly as described. The location was very convenient—just a 2-minute walk to the bus stop that goes directly to the city. The host was extremely responsive and helpful with any questions we had. There was a misunderstanding with the building administration during our stay, and although we expected a more diligent assessment on their part, we were able to clarify everything with proper evidence. Throughout the process, the host remained communicative and very respectful, which we truly appreciated. Overall, a comfortable stay and a host we would recommend.",4
"Jesús is the kindest and most gracious host, we felt right at home! Every time we had a question, Jesús assisted us right away and made sure we were comfortable. The home is beautiful, cozy, and in a beautiful neighbourhood. We had the best visit and would be very happy to stay here again!",5
"Enjoyed my stay! Very clean, walkable surroundings, great communicator, detailed and easy to understand instructions for checking in. Made sure we had everything we needed. Great location with privacy.",5

"Beautiful and clean apartment, nice furniture, beautiful NYC skyline, very nice restaurants around and easy access to NYC.",5
"South Korea Rating, 5 stars , · November 2025 Jesus’s place was perfect. It felt just like home — clean, cozy, and exactly like the photos (even better in person). Jesus was incredibly responsive and helpful throughout our stay. Whenever we had questions, he replied right away, which made everything so easy and stress-free. The washer and dryer were a huge plus, especially while traveling. The fridge had filtered water and an ice dispenser, so we never needed to buy bottled water during our Manhattan trips — such a thoughtful detail. The location was also amazing. It took only about 20–25 minutes to get to Manhattan, which saved us so much time. There were great restaurants and pizza places nearby, and the area felt safe and convenient. This was our first trip to New York, and staying here truly made it unforgettable. We felt happy, comfortable, and cared for every day. We would definitely love to stay here again next time we visit NYC. Highly recommended — truly an amazing stay. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",5
"Wonderful apto, we felt right as we were at home. Jesus was always responsive, extremely kind and helpful. The place was very clean and had everything we needed. The full kitchen allowed us to make our own breakfast, what makes a huge difference for me. The unit was exactly as we see at the picture, very nice, comfortable, clean Plus Jesus provided us a spot in the garage which was a very helpful, since parking in NJ can be a nightmare. I really recommend this Airbnb if you are looking for one place to stay close to NYC, that’s the place . Jesus was always kind and helpful in offering solutions and make sure that everything was right for us and we were comfortable during our stay. Overall, the best hospitality that I ever had in my life Thanks for everything Jesus My honeymoon couldn’t have been so perfect without your attention and help Shirlene",5
Really nice stay close to NYC. Jesus was a phenomenal host and a great communicator. Definitely recommend !,5
"Great location. Super close to the bus stop. Very clean, plenty of space and comfortable. I highly recommend and hope to be back!",5
Perfect little spot away from the city. The view of Manhattan across the river just a quick walk away is to die for :),5
Great place for a quick trip to NY without having to pay NY prices. Easy to get back and forth.,5
"nice, clean, comfy spot. Jesus was very helpful and quick with replies",5
This place is awesome and location is perfect for what we wanted to do. Beautiful place. Definitely coming again…,5
"It was an excellent stay. The hosts' service was very good, they were attentive to all our concerns. The place is very cozy, very clean and organized. The location is strategic, a 3-minute walk from the bus stop to Manhattan (about 25-30 minutes) from the city. We would gladly return to the same place! Translated from Spanish Show original",5
"Great spot, plenty of space, worthy amenities",5
Amazing stay,5
just amazing!!!,5
Great spot not far from the city!,5

"I was pleasantly surprised by this place. It is very well located in a very quiet area 20 minutes from New York. The bus is really next to the accommodation.

"Great price, comfortable bed, great food near by. My only complaint which you get used to was the room was a little bit drafty and you could hear everything from outside and other guests if being loud. Overall, the hosts were great and the place was amazing. Would definitely stay here again in the future.",4
Absolutely enjoyed staying here. Very quick responses to any questions I had at any time. Very helpful with the parking and figuring it out. Overall I felt very safe here and comfortable. I will be staying here in the future. Also easy and cheap to get to time square by bus and the bus stop is right up the street a 1-2 minute walk.,5
"Straight forward instructions and quick detailed responses. Check in was effortless. Room was exactly as pictured. Bed was extra firm and comfortable, pillows and duvet felt luxurious. Linens clean and great quality. Bathroom was clean and sanitized perfectly. Small details that stood out: toiletries, beverages, luggage drop off, privacy. Overall, beautiful studio & safe neighborhood.",5
"I really enjoyed my stay, the description to find the place was detailed, I loved it! The place was clean, comfortable, the place is the same as the pictures, and always responding at all times. Highly recommended and I would take it again if I decide to go to NJ again.",5
"Clean and cozy place. Very responsive host, however keep in mind if you use a car, very hard to find parking at the evening. Also, make sure you read carefully the hosts instructions, there are two houses that look much alike. Overall very good!",5
"We had a lovely stay! The place was comfortable and exactly as described. Mel was truly amazing, her quick responses meant a great deal to us and made everything so easy. Highly recommend!",5
"10/10 - Absolutely loved this stay! Everything was amazing, between the view, the price, the room, everything was clean and every question I had was answered in just moments. I am planning another trip to NJ next year and will definitely be booking this space again if available.",5
"Review of BNB Stay – Average Experience My stay at this BNB was overall average. The biggest issue was the lack of proper soundproofing. Music played loudly throughout the night, making it very difficult to sleep. I raised the concern with the owners ( happening 2 nights) , and they asked me to message if the music continued after 23:00. I did so, but the music still did not stop. Their response was to “adjust for today” and that the issue would be addressed tomorrow. Unfortunately, the same problem persisted, and since it was my last day, I had no choice but to manage with limited sleep before vacating. Even though the owners assured me they would resolve the issue, nothing was actually done. Pros: • Room size is decent • Bed is comfortable • Bathroom is tidy • Shared kitchen is clean, with fridge and stove available for use Cons: • Not ideal for New York travel, as it’s far from main attractions • Commuting to New York is challenging • Very noisy street • No proper soundproofing",3
Great play to stay in if you want quiet & comfort. Easy transportation to Time Square taking NJ transit near the place. Would recommend to a friend!,5
Most consistent bnb team on this app. Always on point with everything and always making accommodations for us. Can never go wrong 5/5! -A.B ☮️,5

Hatis was extremely kind and helpful. My luggage arrived one day late and she went all the way to help me - from calling Delta to lending me her son's clothes without me asking. The place was clean and cozy! Location was great as there's a NJ transit bus stop right in front of the building. You could get into midtown Manhattan under 20 minutes from the apartment. Highly recommended! I'd stay there again when I'm in NY!,5
"Simply the best of stays! What views of Manhattan and you couldn’t be any closer to Manhattan by bus! The journey was never a problem! Cosy and comfortable, loved every moment of my stay at Hatis the best of hosts!",5
"I have good memories with This stay, This place very comfortable and Beautiful views from window and Bus station just downstairs to Manhatta just 20 min from west and Hatis very friendly",5
"Hatis place was absolutely Amazing, and she's the Best Host! So friendly and accommodating. Her apartment is super cozy, I felt right at home. Also, the view of the Manhattan skyline is FANTASTIC!!! The place is only a few minutes by bus to Manhattan's Port Authority Bus Terminal and you can connect with the Subway there too. Pro tip, download the NJ Transit app in advance, it'll be easier to purchase tickets for the bus 😉 I'd Absolutely stay again at Hatis place, 1000% recommend ❤️❤️❤️",5
"Hatis’s home is very friendly and peaceful. Clean, comfortable bed, great view of the New York skyline, a park and good cafe right across the street, bus stop at the front door and a 15 minute ride right to the Port Authority on 42nd Street. Haiti’s met me at the door, helped with luggage, and got me settled in very quickly. Highly recommend.",5
"My stay at Hatis’s place was excellent! I was able to work there without any issues, it’s a calm and pleasant environment. Hatis is very responsive and attentive. I definitely recommend this place. It’s also easy to reach from Manhattan: about 20–25 minutes from Port Authority, with a bus stop right in front of the building.",5
"I was very satisfied with my stay! The location of the house is perfect – with the bus right in front, I was in the city center within 15 minutes, even faster than most of my friends staying downtown. Hatice is a wonderful host: the apartment was spotless, the view was amazing, safe, and very comfortable. I loved the thoughtful touch of having tea and coffee waiting for me in the kitchen. Thank you, Hatice, for these 2 days,for the Turkish coffee and I wish you all the best!",5
I had THE most amazing time staying with Hatis! She truly is a special person and is so fun to be around. We had some long chats and she made me feel beyond comfortable. The apartment is super fuzzy and the view is simply breathtaking. Everything was perfect! There is a supermarket in walking distance and the bus to Times Square leaves right in front of the house - it only takes you about 20 minutes to get there! I highly recommend staying with Hatis! When I come back to visit New York I’ll 100% make sure to stay with her again!,5
This place was so awesome! Super easy to find & amazing views of the city from the windows. Harris was flexible & very friendly. I was able to take the bus easily into NYC for $4.10 right in front of her place. Highly recommend staying here if you are coming to nyc!,5
"Amazing host, very good coffee, and a lovely room with a great view of the skyline of NYC.",5
Hatis is very friendly and welcoming! Her place is very cozy and has a great view and area around!!,5
"I had a lovely week at Hatice's place — she was very kind and welcoming, and made me feel at home right away. The apartment is cozy and well-located, just a 20-minute bus ride from Times Square, with the stop right outside the building. The view from the room is also amazing! I highly recommend staying here. Thank you again, Hatice!",5
Hatice was an amazing host and I felt comfortable right away. It was nice to have a chat with her and she recommended at lot of things one can do in New York. From the room you have an amazing view of Manhattan and everything was nice and clean. It‘s super easy to get to Manhattan with bus or even ferry.,5
"Nice and homely, Hatice is very hospitable and helpful..comfortable bed and clean apartment. Would recommend.",5
"The apartment is beautiful and stylish! Very warm and welcoming🤗 It’s quiet, safe, convenient to Manhattan, and I had wonderful two nights here.🥰 Hatis was very responsible, friendly and she has made the place home to everyone. Will book it for sure next time to New York.",5
Stayed here for just a few days over Memorial day weekend and it was lovely! My view was incredible and apartment close enough for easy trips back and forth to the city! For the price and location don't think I could've gotten any lucker. Thanks Hattice!,5
"If you are looking for a cosy place with a beautiful view on Manhattan, Hatice's bedroom is the best place. Only at 20 min by bus from Manhattan, with a discrete and inspiring host. You can only love it ! I recommend Hative bedroom and will certainly come back ! Thanks again Hatice",5
"I had a very amazing magic stay at Hatices place. Hatice is a very warm and welcoming host and definitely made my stay there unforgettable. The room is romantic and decorated with details and I immediately felt at home. The view is so amazing I couldn’t get enough. Right in front of the buildings door there’s a bus station and in 15 min. you get to the Time Square. The buses come very frequently, so it was perfect. Thank you so much Hatice for hosting me. I would definitely come back again. ❤️",5
"Hatice and Can are awesome, super helpful and extremely accommodating. if your visiting the city and have any work on the west end, would definitely book this place if you get the chance.",5
"13 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · May 2025 If you are visiting NYC, don’t hesitate to book Hatice’s place! It’s so close to Manhattan and the bus stops right in front of the house. There is so much to love about this place - the view is exceptional, the room is spacious and the bed really comfortable. Hatice is a wonderful host. She is kind, sociable and by the end of my stay she felt like a friend I’ve known for years! Her hospitality is second to none and staying with her felt truly wonderful. The bus takes about 20 minutes to get to Port Authority via the Lincoln tunnel and runs frequently. It’s also easy to get to Hatice’s place from Newark airport. I look forward to staying again - highly recommend this place ☺️",5
Haiti’s is friendly and showed great hospitality.,5
"Hatis was a lovely, welcoming host. Her place was exactly as advertised with Manhattan in easy reach by bus or -- much nicer! -- ferry.",5
"7 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · April 2025 Hatice is very warm & welcoming, I felt right at home. She is helpful & I enjoyed our many conversations. A delightful stay.",5
"7 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · October 2025 It was a perfect accommodation. It was a comfortable space like home. I was happy to see the Manhattan view through the window of my room. Also, there was a bus stop to Manhattan right in front of the accommodation, so it was very convenient. Hatis is a warm and positive person. Thanks to you, I was able to enjoy my trip to New York better. I was also grateful for the coffee and tea you prepared every day. I'll definitely go to New York again during the Christmas season someday! See you again, Hatis! Translated from Korean Show original",5
"We loved our stay at this Airbnb. The location was ideal and easy to get around. The Airbnb itself was great, looked just like the pictures. The room and bathroom were clean. The bathroom is shared with other guests but it does not cause any disturbances. Will definitely recommend!",5
"This is a great spot for a short visit. It i close to the subway and short walking distance to the Midtown tourist core. There is only one bathroom to share among the four rooms, and it is possible to hear other guests through the walls. But it was inexpensive and in a good location, so these minor inconveniences made it worth it to me. If you happen to be looking for a spot to stay overnight while you're in town for a play--like Masquerade, for example--this is an excellent choice!",4
"Stayed for 3 nights and absolutely loved the location! Walkable to absolutely anything whether that’s food, subway stations, shopping stores, and tourist spots. You share a bathroom with other people so keep that in mind, but the locks in each room still made our space feel personal. More than enough room for resting and getting ready before going out to see the city.",5
"What a great find in NYC! I felt comfortable and safe, it was an easy location for where I needed to be (access to subway, walkable from Central Park and Chelsea). I would absolutely stay here again!",5
"Enjoyed my stay at Michelle’s place, great host. Room was a bit chilly, but a space heater was available.",5
Being some blocks away from Times Square is just fantastic. Also you get a good and cozy sleep.,5
"Michelle’s place was a perfect fit for us. Great location (not too close to the loud and crowded Times Square/Broadway area, yet close enough to walk). Nice decor and very clean modern feel. Very comfortable bed! Highly recommend her ABnB to any single or couple to book for a great Manhattan experience! Thanks!",5
"Michelle's place is an EXCELLENT value for your money! It is centric, close to a bus/train station, and a short walking distance to Times Square, Broadway, Central Park and other major attractions. I had an amazing stay! Everything was clean, cozy, and just as described. Michelle was very quick to reply and always very willing to help. If I'm ever back in NYC, I would definitely stay here again :)",5
"Michelle was a great host. Gave very clear directions, couldn't have been easier to get into her place. She was very responsive when I needed her and her place is in the perfect location with everything you could want around the area. There's a grocery store right across the street and restaurants/bars all over the place. Her place is a short drive under 10mins from the train station and walking distance to the theater district (10mins) or other things like 20-30mins. We walked everywhere and was very easy to get around. The room had a microwave, mini fridge and hot plate. Made it super convenient for us to cook up our own food. You are on a floor with 4 other rooms with everyone sharing 1 bathroom. There was no issues with that and everyone respected the bathroom rules laid out. Only thing was the people in 1 of the rooms were loud after quiet hours which was unfortunate but other than that we had a great stay. highly recommended",5
The space was in a wonderful location! Within walking distance to so much NYC fun and close to the trains to travel to other parts of the city! The room was clean and comfy! Such cute decor! Loved that there was a convenient store right downstairs as well! I’d stay again for sure!,5
"Great stay! I was a solo traveler who didn’t quite feel comfortable with the idea of a hostel or pod type hotel. This was the perfect place and very well kept! I never had an issue with the shared restroom, it was very clean, easily accessible, and well stocked. The location was also great for me! I explored great landmarks of the city via subway, walks, and Ubers —- very close to time square and lots of other really delicious places to eat (that were also open late) I felt safe and enjoyed having the accessibility to stop and take breaks at the Airbnb throughout the days exploring.",5
The private room is located in a fantastic location with easy access to subway and buses. The room was very clean and so was a shared bathroom as it was cleaned daily. We felt safe and comfortable. Highly recommended.,5
"Michelle was proactive about checking in and making sure I had a great stay! The location is very close to Times Square and various subway stations. The interior was also clean and instructions were very simple to enter. Perfect stay for exploring, and great price!",5
"A perfect place to stay for exploring Manhattan. Everything was clean and well-maintained, and the atmosphere was peaceful despite being in the center of the city. I loved how easy it was to get around from there. I would definitely stay here again.",5
Stay was overall amazing. Was a bit difficult to find as it’s somewhat hidden but area surrounding has lots of food choices. Super close to the main New York attractions…great stay.,5
"Nice, clean place with a great location. Two drawbacks, though: Several air conditioning units mounted immediately outside the window made significant noise. I had no trouble sleeping with it, though. The sheets had a fuzzy texture I was not used to. I'd have preferred sheets with less friction.",5
"The place was Good , location is the best for the first time visitors as me, clean and well organised! Michelle and the team are professionals and ready to solve problems very quickly ! I would advise the place for all first time visitors !",4
"I really enjoyed my stay here! Although the arraival was a little confusing it was okay, and being at top 3min from Timesquare really was a nice but welcomed bonus, the price is fair for NYC .",5
"Centrally located, clean and nice bed! Would stay here again.",5
perfect for my one night stay!,5
Good room and everything was clean.,5
Perfect location! walking distance to everything's and a super responsive and helpful host.,5
"The location was amazing, quick walk to Times Square, very clean and Michelle was a great hostess!",5
"Pretty good spot , affordable and enjoyable, only thing was the harsh smell in the hallways",4
I enjoyed my short stay at Michelle’s . It was a but intimidating but later I met a nice group of staff that were very helpful and kind.,5
Perfect location!,5
"Great place to stay, easy and clear instructions. Overall highly recommended!",5
"The location is great -- very close to a subway station and some great restaurants and attractions! However, there are serious issues with the rental unit. The address listed on Airbnb does not match the real address, which is only provided two days in advance via a third party website. This is also not an apartment, but one room among many in a basement that's been renovated for Airbnb. Finally, as a basement unit in NYC, expect cockroaches.",3
Very great experience and host,5
Thanks. It was a wonderful place. Will book again,5
"I got a great deal on the Jungle Room in Hells Kitchen and had a great stay. Very easy self-check in with clear instructions. Place was very clean including bathroom. Close to Times Square, Broadway and Central Park. Thanks!!",5
"Horrible service. I got lost, I tried reaching out and she was very mean lazy got upset when I couldn’t figure out the instructions when they were wrong. The only reason she gets one is because I can’t go horribly overpriced for how lazy she is does not deserve a good rating",1
"Very clean and felt safe with locks both to the apartment and to my room. The room was very clean, except some nasty long black hairs in the linen. But most of it was excellent and clean. The communication with the host was pretty bad though, she said to reach out with any questions and I tried to reach her like 5 times over a 1,5 day period and she never replied. Just automated messages completely ignoring my messages. Very frustrating. Kitchen is not really a kitchen just some shelves. But location is great, and still a good find for the price.",3
"Stayed 3 nights. Loved the location in Hell’s Kitchen area. Lots of restaurants. We walked easily to Central Park, Madison Avenue, Times Square, Rockefeller center. Easy to Uber or take subway for further away outings. Totally as described in other reviews…. very small bedroom space, bed is comfortable, quiet especially considering it’s a busy area, very clean, shared bathroom though we didn’t see other guests at all, felt safe, Michelle gave very clear instructions on how to enter the building prior to checkin. Enjoyed our stay and would recommend to others!",5
"I came to NYC for 4 days, had activities planned and a full schedule, so this room perfectly met my needs. A bed, a closet, a small table and chair. I basically slept and changed clothes. The bathroom is clean and plenty of hot water for a shower. Kitchen area has everything you need to stay a few days, and there’s a big refrigerator with plenty of space for everything. I slept like a baby, no street noise at all. I will definitely include Michelle’s accommodations again next time I visit NYC.",5
Super satisfied with my stay !! Room was super clean when I arrived & the area was perfect !! There are 3 doors to get to the room which made me feel super safe !! Definitely recommend !,5
"That was really good for two days. Just fyi you don’t have separate kitchen room, you just have a place to cook on the passage between rooms. Really pricey but it’s New York :)",4
"Pretty expensive, but you pay for the great location. Great for spending a few days in the city when you want to be central. The room was fine for one person, could be a bit tight for two people with big suitcases. All in all a nice stay and especially a great neighborhood.",5
"A spotless place with a shared bathroom with everything you need. The price seems a little expensive, but it makes up for it with its cleanliness. Translated from Turkish Show original",5
Location location location,5
"My stay was excellent, Michelle was very helpful to us. The accommodation is just like the photos, the bathroom is quite clean and has everything you need. She made it easy for me at check-out. Very grateful Translated from Spanish Show original",5
"Everything was excellent, in terms of price-quality, it is what is necessary and it has a super good location, the only thing is that the bathroom is shared and although it is presentable at times it smelled a little bad but it was because of the other guests, since they did not leave it so clean. Michelle's service was excellent. Translated from Spanish Show original",5
👍,5
"The room was – as often the case in New York – very small, really only suitable for sleeping. The location was great (just minutes from Times Square) and everything was clean – including the bathroom you share with other guests and where the toilet is located. Unfortunately, the host was difficult to reach and only responded to our message after a longer period of time. After all, we were allowed to leave our luggage earlier. Overall ok for New York, but you should know that the space is very limited. Translated from German Show original",4
Great,5
"The place was in *such* a great part of town, and the room was as described. I was worried sharing a bathroom with four other rooms might be chaotic, but there was only one time where it was even a bit of an issue. The place was clean. There was a Keurig in the room, but no cups provided, so bring your own if you want to take advantage of that! My only concern was that the address was different than advertised, which had me a bit concerned about the accuracy of the rest of the listing, but I can confirm that the place felt secure and the rest of the listing is very accurate! On the border of midtown and Hell’s Kitchen; you won’t find a better deal! Thanks, Michelle!",5
"Everything went well, place was very clean and cozy, loved that such a tiny room had a TV. Room and bathroom were great, and small kitchenette also carried coffeemaker and mircowave which were handy for our last morning before checkout. Only there was miscommunication with early bag drop-off, as we arrived early but couldn’t get it, texted Michelle and there was no response and neither further communications she mentioned and apologized for not responding as we were standing outside waiting for 20mins in cold. Ended up dropping our bags at hotel nearby. Overall great location, walkable to most tourist places, good value for money for NYC at Christmas season.",5
"I wasn't expecting a lot when I jumped on this space. it was clean, comfortable, had shades that were good enough to black out the room. Granted it wouldn't have gotten much sun anyways, but there's always something with a room being completely dark that just makes it that much more cozy when laying down for bed. You hear next to no street noise in this space. The only real issues were doors squeaking and it being a shared space with others, but I personally couldn't count that against the space. it is well within walking distance to everything you could want to go to in NYC. I highly recommend!",4
"excellent location, although the bathroom is shared, there is very good privacy. 100% recommended Translated from Spanish Show original",5
"I enjoyed my stay, the location was walking distance away from Times Square and Central Park! There were many food options near as well. I would comeback again.",5
"A small room (still good for 2 people with small luggage) in a very good location. Close to Central Park, Times Square, metro stops, and grocery stores.",5
"This place is at excellent location, 12 mins walking distance to Time Square and a few mins to 50St. subway. It's in the basement at the back of main road so it's really quiet. There are two locks in the front building, one at the basement door. and another one at the room door. My friend and I are two females, even we came back late (around 11.30pm) we still feel safe. It's super clean just like the photos. Since it's a shared space there are 3 rooms share one washroom. We need to manage the time to use the washroom. The host provides shampoo, body wash, hair dyer, cotton swab and towels. There is a TV and AC in the room, but the AC is a bit loud so we turn if off in the night. Host is responsive and the check-in instructions is easy to understand. Overall, it's a great place, we will stay there again if we go to NY in the future.",5
"7 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · December 2025 Can’t say enough about Willow and her place! It was spotless, warm and beautiful. Willow was such an incredible host, always fast to respond and provide any information we needed such as how to get to the city and local restaurants when we arrived late! Such a great time. We will absolutely be back to stay when we come back to New York! An absolute must stay for everyone! Thank you Willow!!!",5
"I was only staying for one night for a layover but wanted to see as much of the city in that time. The room was great, easy to get to central Manhattan quickly and the views across the Hudson was one of my highlights of the trip, incredible skyline view. While I didn’t see willow in person she was very helpful for activity and food recommendations for my visit. The house was on a nice street and spacious inside, recommend highly.",5

It's greatly located, easy access to public transport, friendly neighbourhood and great view of NYC buildings and Hudson River from the area. What makes this Air BnB special is the super gorgeous Willow. She is the BEST host we ever came across with. She is a description of a perfect host. Such a beautiful soul and full of love! Highly recommended!",5
Had a great stay at Willows place! She was very responsive and gave great recommendations. It was just a 10 minutes bus ride to New York for Christmas. Her place was very clean and organized with towels and lines set up for us when we got there. I recommend staying here!,5
"My husband and I had a wonderful over night stay during a layover between airports. Willow was very responsive, friendly and left very clear instructions on how to get in etc. Would definitely stay here again. Great location with only a 3 min walk to local restaurants and coffee shops and scenic views of downtown!",5
"The house is conveniently located near the bus stop. We were happy to have access to the kitchen and washing machine. What stood out was the level of privacy: even though the bathroom is shared, Willow was a great host and granted us a lot of space and freedom. Highly recommend! We'll certainly look to stay here on our next trip to New York",5
"Willow is an amazing host. She is very responsive and always trying to help us out from the queries we asked her. She allowed us early checkin. Her place feels like home to stay. No disturbance at all. Washroom, bedroom, lounge and kitchen was pristine clean. Would love to come back and happy to recommend to others too!",5
"Willow was a great host and very friendly in-person! Check-in instructions were very clear and we had no issue finding the location and getting inside. All the rooms in the house were very clean and we were able to make ourselves at home. Weehawken was the perfect place to spend our nights to sleep and the ferry station was close enough to walk to to commute to the city. Also within walking distance is a gorgeous view of the Manhattan skyline. Thank you, Willow!",5
"Willow was an amazing host! Very proactive, respectful, and provided very helpful information as someone in Jersey for the first time! The house is so beautiful, clean and a block away from the prettiest riverside view of New York!",5
"Our stay was short, but we enjoyed every minute of it. Willow was super kind, we didn’t get to know her, but she was so warm and responsive to our inquiries prior and during the stay. We would definitely love to come back and stay again. The view of Manhattan is also incredible from here.",5

"11 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · October 2025 This was the most perfect comfortable place with absolute breathtaking views just 1/2 block down. The whole neighborhood is beautiful.

"11 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · August 2025 Willow's place is really nice. It's quiet and spacious. Comfortable bed with good- sized room. The facilities were great, and it was easy to walk down to the end of the street and get a bus to Manhatten. We didn't see Willow during our stay but she communicated well with us.",5
"I'd 100% recommend Willow's place. From the easy commute NYC>NJ>NYC, to clear instructions on how to check in, to restaurant recommendations, to friendly conversations and finally to the great spot to stay while visiting the city. I was a bit nervous about staying outside of NYC since my plans were all there, but boy was I wrong. Commuting to and from the Port Authority Bus Terminal is very simple and fast. You also have the ferry option which is a bit more expensive but worth it if you want to avoid traffic or want a beautiful view of the skyline. And speaking of that, what an amazing view you get of the city once you hop off the bus in Weehawken! Check in was smooth, bedroom was comfortable and shared bathroom was not a problem. Everything was clean and it almost felt we had the place to ourselves. A snowstorm hit NY when we arrived, so we had to change our plans a bit on the first day and stay in NJ, but there were great restaurants walking distance from the house. Thank you Willow",5
"9 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · November 2025 wonderful location, a choice of catching a short ferry across to Times Square or the v near and frequent buses to the central train options.",5
"Our stay at Willow’s was wonderful! The location is perfect for that budget traveler looking to stay somewhere that feels like home. Easy transportation on the 128/166/165 route from the corner into Manhatten. Download the NJ Transit app and pre-purchase tickets each time! From there let your feet or the subway take you anywhere! The bed was super comfortable, and everything was meticulously clean. Willow had a great selection of teas and coffee with various sugars and some creamer to start the day right! The view at night time of the Manhattan skyline is not to be missed! Easily walkable to many restaurants and local grocery at Lidl. Will look up availability next time I am in the area!",5
Couldn’t have asked for a better place to stay! Willow was extremely communicative and was very helpful with directions. This spot is so close to the bus stop which took us directly to NYC in less than 10 minutes!! The place was nice and homey - def would consider coming back next time I’m in the area!,5
"We stayed for just one night, and everything was perfect. The host was very friendly and provided clear, easy-to-follow instructions for check-in and the home. The space was immaculate, uncluttered, and had a calm, welcoming feel. The bed was incredibly comfortable, which made for a great night’s sleep. Highly recommend!",5
Willow’s apartment is amazingly clean and very beautiful! She was very responsive and communication went very well. The location deserves to be highlighted as it was just a few minutes walk to the bus stop to get into Port Authority Bus Terminal. Within less than 15 minutes you are in Time Square. We would highly recommend this apartment!,5
"Willow was an excellent host! Her place was quiet, very clean, and her instructions were extremely detailed. The bed was also really comfortable, to the point we asked what mattress it was! She was available for any and all questions, was proactive in her communication, and quick with her responses. I'm very grateful she opened her home to my daughter and me! I can definitely recommend her as a host! Thank you, Willow!",5
"This was an amazing location, especially for the price. Like anywhere outside of New York City, you can use public transportation or a Lyft driver as we did. The place was easy to find, easy to get into, and was in great condition. The host wasn’t even there, so it was very private. We didn’t stay very long inside, but I would definitely book here again for another trip.",5
"Perfect Location for NY. We were in the apartment for 6 days and really enjoyed the stay at Tony’s beautiful apartment! The apartment is close to the subway and in a silent area.

"I’ve traveled all over the blue green planet and can honestly say, without hyperbole, that my weeklong stay at this late 19th century architectural masterpiece tucked away in historic Hamilton Heights of West Harlem is one of the most memorable and magical Airbnb stays I’ve experienced yet. The neighborhood, the art, the history, the energy, the little Italian restaurant around the corner (that perfect bolognese), and the most generous hospitality — my only serious complaint is that I found it extremely difficult to leave! This place is an absolute NYC lover’s dream. Thank you for everything Tony, I can’t wait to return.",5
"Tony has been a great host and provided a warm welcome ! The room itself is quiet and very comfortable, and located inside a spacious, stunning building. The neirbourhood is really nice, with a lot of deli shops, a subway nearby and coffeeshops. We loved the place !",5
Tony was such a gracious host and so very kind. He always responded to messages within an hour and was available to give us recommendations of things to do in the city. The house is beautiful and the neighborhood was quiet.,5
"Tony was an excellent host! He was super hospitable, and gave very detailed information on the house and its' amenities – he was always very responsive to any messages, and any queries in person as well. Seems like he has a lot of cool stories to tell! The photos do not do justice to the beauty of the house, and the room itself was so delightfully spacious with a great view! The neighborhood is also super peaceful, and easy to navigate, especially when heading downtown. Great place, would highly recommend staying with Tony! Thanks a bunch for the amazing stay.",5
"A great place to stay in New York. We probably wouldn't have visited Harlem if we hadn't booked a place to stay in this area. We were very happy with our stay. It's a beautiful area, and Tony is a great host who recommended some great places.",5
"Tony’s place is a haven that feels like a home away from home. Although I was born and raised in New York, I now reside in a different city. It’s wonderful to find a place where you eagerly anticipate returning to your hometown. Tony’s home is that kind of space. If you appreciate the beauty of well-kept old brown stones that radiate warmth, coziness, and cleanliness, then Tony’s home is the place for you. I thoroughly enjoyed my visit there.",5
A beautiful and spacious room! Tony was very responsive and helpful during our stay. This is a great spot to stay while visiting NYC!,5
Tony was amazing and very responsible. He went far and beyond to make my stay comfortable. He even helped me with my heavy luggage and made sure I boarded. This has been the best experience so far as a guest. I recommend him 100% and I hope to return. He also gave me great advice on how to start in the art world.,5
Tony was a host you could only dream of but he's real! He greets you at the door and is very responsive. He gave me a tour of his beautiful home which feels like I'm stepping into history. The location is safe and I walked by myself alone at night and felt comfortable. The train is a 7min walk away. The room was huge!! If you have claustrophobia stay here because you can move and breathe easy. Great stay and I will be back. 😊,5
"We had a great stay at Tony's place. When we arrived, he was there to welcome us and show us around his lovely home. We really enjoyed the art and antiques located throughout. The location worked for us because it was quiet and a quick walk to the subway, making it easy for us to get to everything we wanted to see and do.",5
"Every review you read is spot on. This is one of the most fabulous places we’ve ever stayed and by far,the most unique experience. Tony is an incredible human being.

"My stay overall was nice, the host was very communicative and friendly and the bus route to get into New York was very easy and convenient. When I booked my stay I didn’t realize there would be other people in the home besides the host, so just be aware there are multiple rooms all sharing one bathroom.",4
"Great place to stay. Check in was very easy thanks to Odalis’s instructions. Good location, buses that go to NYC- port authority bus terminal, usually arrive early and it takes about 30-40 minutes to get there so pretty easy. For tickets-download NJ transit app and select interstate 2 zone ride. Room was accurate and really nice, everything clean. Thank you for hosting me!",5

"Great spot for solo travellers, long or short stay. Odalis was great, responsive, kind. Definitely will stay on my next trip. Amazing Host.",5
"The host is very attentive, and the cleanliness of the place is a big plus. However, I did experience some noise at night and had trouble sleeping at times. Also, the connection between NJ and NY is complicated and expensive: the transportation is not very comfortable, often crowded, expensive, and sometimes infrequent. Still, the view of NY from NJ is definitely worth it If you’re a city fan like me.",4
"Odalis is a very friendly and helpful host, and the room and bathroom are immaculately clean! You can get to Port Authority in less than half an hour and there are so many great restaurants in the neighbourhood so the location is great!",5

"This was my first experience in an Airbnb accommodation with shared spaces, and I must say it was absolutely positive! Gloria is an exceptional host, very welcoming, helpful and caring. It immediately made me feel at home. The room was clean and comfortable, and the apartment in general is well maintained. Despite sharing common spaces, the coexistence was very quiet and respectful of privacy. Translated from Italian Show original",5
"Gloria is a very nice woman with whom you can have a nice chat. If I had any questions, Gloria was happy to help me. The room is as described & perfect for one person in New York / Brooklyn. I felt very comfortable & safe & would come back. Translated from German Show original",5
"A very good deal if you plan on being out all day. The room is small though and the walls are thin, just be aware of that. Weird hole in ceiling above the bed, I don't know what that was. Glorias dog either did not like me or was nervous about having strangers in the house- he barked a lot anytime I came home.",3
"I had a wonderful time at Gloria's. She is a lovely host and I felt right at home. It was my first time travelling solo and Gloria made me feel very comfortable. Thank you again so much, I will definitely be visiting again if I'll return to New York, and recommend your place to others.",5
"My stay at Gloria’s place was amazing, I couldn’t have asked for better! The place is located in a beautiful residential neighborhood with restaurants, bakeries, delis, etc. The place is cozy and feels just like home and has everything you might need. And Gloria is an amazing host! Friendly, knowledgeable, accommodating, welcoming, she answered all my questions and helped me with everything I needed. I would totally recommend. Thank you, Gloria!",5
"Gloria's house is very cozy and comfortable. I was able to rest very well in the room and I found everything very consistent with the description that Gloria provided. Freedom (the dog) is very nice and friendly, as is the owner. I will definitely return and recommend the accommodation to more people Translated from Portuguese Show original",5
"Gloria was very friendly and helpful, and was never invasive. The house is very nice and so is the neighborhood Translated from Spanish Show original",5
Gloria communicate really well before arrival and was very welcoming to me when I ran into her. Her place is in a great location and good value,4
The price is really great! The apartment looks exactly like the pictures. Gloria is super nice and always answers and helps quickly. I can only recommend this airbnb!,5
"The stay at Gloria's place was excellent! I had a small room that looked exactly like the pictures, the bathroom was always available for me and the whole house was at my disposal and was very well equipped and nicely decorated. There is a central train station a 15-minute walk away and the neighborhood is very safe, even at night. Recommend! The most important thing - Gloria was completely available for me and helped me nicely.",5
"Everything was great! From the location, the room, the skyline view, the hosts’ friendly hospitality. The stay added to my NYC experience being able to see what daily life is like in the neighborhoods/Burroughs with all the coffee shops, restaurants, bars. I loved everything about it. Close to ALL of the major NYC attractions- all over Manhattan I was able to walk, rent Citi E-Bikes, bus rides, subway stations to get around very easily with Google Maps. Definitely recommend Reka’s place in East Village. Great experience.",5
Would 100% stay here again. Very quiet neighborhood but still easy to access to everything with a short walk. It was freezing outside but the hosts kept the space nice and warm. Very welcoming.,5
"Reka & her partner were great hosts and super kind. I adored the area nearby as it was very interactive plus everything was just right outside. The room was also very comfortable. The lighting during the day was lovely, and ambient at night. Overall I loved their space and had a great experience. It’s perfect for experiencing the city with a more local atmosphere. Definitely a great choice, for sure would stay again!",5
"Quiet and peaceful neighbourhood. 5 min walk to many buses. Appreciated that Bus M14D, in particular, had frequent service. What I loved most was how cosy the apartment felt - the decor and extensive collection of plants gave life to the space!Bed was reaaaaally comfortable and felt like hotel grade mattress. Shower hot with high water pressure. Face linens were so lux! Reka and Adam were friendly, responsive, and accommodating with special requests. Would stay here again if I were to return to NYC. Highly recommend!",5
"Great neighbourhood, more residential with lots of good restaurants and bars to check out, easy commute to more tourist parts of NYC. Make sure to check Reka’s guidebook with her recommendations. The room and apartment looks just like in the pictures, I had a very comfortable and pleasant stay.",5
I loved the decoration. Home was quiet. Place included elevator. Host was very responsive.,5
"The apartment is cozy, quiet and clean, and the neighborhood is nice with businesses nearby. Instructions for checking in were clear.",5
"The apartment was cozy and homely, in a quiet and peaceful area. The host was very responsive and pleasant.",5
"I had a lovely stay at Reka’s place in the Lower East Side. The room was spotless, cozy-comfortable, the AC worked perfectly, and everything was just as described. The location was the reason I booked it; conveniently located walking distance to shopping and Russ & Daughters. What really stood out was how communicative and friendly Reka was. She was incredibly easy to coordinate with, even when my train was delayed and I arrived late. Although I didn’t get to meet her in person, her helpfulness and warm communication made my stay smooth and enjoyable. It felt like I was staying with a friend in LES, and I'd totally stay here again.",5
"Loved staying with Reka. If you wanna experience the real New York and not just Midtown but still have a central location, this is the place. The neighborhood felt very save and alive but it was still quite most nights. The room had the perfect size and I felt really comfortable coming back from an exhausting day exploring every night. I made myself breakfast in the kitchen every morning and even did my laundry once. Reka explained everything and if I had any additional questions she would help me out right away. I would highly recommend staying with Reka, especially if you want to feel like a real New Yorker!",5
"I had a great stay at Rekas place and would definitely come again!! I loved the apartment and atmosphere, especially the view from the balcony. I also really enjoyed how reachable everything was by foot in this neighborhood. You can even take the city bikes to drive to central park :) I would recommend this place for everybody who wants to get the experience of living like a local in NYC. :)",5
"Reka has an amazing apartment and you will really love it if you have a creative vibe. Her kitchen and living room is full of plants and there is a real homely feel. From day one of my stay, I felt like I was staying in my own home with full access to the kitchen. The apartment is in a very thriving neighborhood bustling with activities and a plethora of bars, cafes, and restaurants. I highly recommend staying at her apartment!",5
"This was such an amazing place! Very clean, tidy, and super cute apartment. Reka was extremely communicative and gave awesome neighborhood recommendations. I also loved being in the East Village. The area is so fun and the apartment is literally on the same block as a nice coffee shop, bar, and convenience store. I stayed here for nearly 2 weeks and felt right at home. 10/10 recommend!",5
"Good location and easy check in. I stayed for a concert at Barclays and the transportation routes were an easy straight shot, just one bus ride and train stop away. Instructions in the description were useful for navigation. Even though it’s a shared space, it didn’t feel like it (in a good way). Would stay again.",5
"I had a wonderful stay at Reka’s place in the East Village! The room was comfortable and cozy, and I especially loved all the beautiful plants that made the space feel so warm and inviting. Reka was a fantastic host—welcoming, communicative, and thoughtful. Everything was just as described, and I felt right at home. I would absolutely stay here again. Highly recommend!",5
"Rena's stay was just what I was looking for while being in the city for a few days. It was comfortable, had an elevator, and she even let me put a few groceries in the fridge. She was very pleasant and I had the main plain virtually to myself most of the evening. The rate was unbeatable, as well. Highly recommend staying here!",5
"Great place stay, perfect location for my trip. Felt very safe and comfortable!",5
"Clean and comfortable and quiet. Only thing is that it’s a 15-min from subway, but bus is very convenient.",5
"13 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · August 2025 I really enjoyed my stay at Reka’s. She was lovely and easy to communicate with. The place is very cute and in a great location.",5
"I was not around much but to sleep and shower. Communication with Reka was excellent and easy. Very proactive. Her partner also recommended a few places for nibbles and cocktails. Very good recs, had a fun time and all walking distance. Apartment was impeccable but not at all sterile, totally comfy cozy lived in bohemian beautiful. Felt right at home. Bed also comfy cozy— so important. Shower hot. All the makings for an excellent weekend. Thank you Reka and Adam!!",5
I stayed at Reka’s place for two nights and wish I could have stayed longer. The place was neat and washroom was always clean. It’s in great location and is also safe for solo female travelers. Would definitely come back to stay here. Super cozy vibes and feels like home.,5
"Reka and Adam were the best hosts a guy could hope for! The apartment is located in a gorgeous neighborhood with tons of restaurants and walkable bars nearby. If you book, make sure to check out Tompkins Square Park, it's a classic.",5
"I had a great time. Reka's place was very clean and well-put-together. Alphabet City, where the place is located, is very vibrant and yet not as choatic as downtown. Reka herself was very friendly and responsive.",5
"I had a pleasant stay at Reka’s apartment in the East Village. The location is excellent for walking around and enjoying the neighborhood and seeing more of the city. The apartment is clean & tidy, with plenty of nice touches in the kitchen + living room. The street is quiet, and the bedroom has a really nice view of lower Manhattan. Reka was a welcoming host and clear with communication and instructions for getting in. I was comfortable and I recommend staying here for experiencing what the neighborhood has to offer.",5
"the location is pretty good, it takes only 20 minutes to nyc. you pretty much get what you paid for, the room does its job of accommodating travelers who wants to visit nyc. not the greatest place if you plan on staying in since its quite a small room. gurhan was very responsive to all my questions. all in all, I had a good time here.",5
"The place is really great. Some might feel its away from the city centre but I felt it to be quite recharging after the non stop chaos of NYC and the bus stop is just outside(frequency of busses is quite high) which take 20 mins to reach NYC. The view of the skyline of NYC both in day and night is quite mesmerizing. The park nearby gives perfect spot for that. The place had everything which was mentioned, its a quiet neighborhood and a good pizza and Chinese place 3 mins walk away, so all in all I think its a great deal if one wants to take a break after all day chaos in NYC",5
The location is amazing! It is close to public transport and also to one of the best views of NYC's skyline. The place was kept very clean and the other tenants were polite as well. Amazing stay and would recommend to anyone!,5
"I liked everything about it, he’s friendly and very helpful on how to get to and from the city",5
"I stayed for a little over a week and it was a great stay, would definitely recommend booking",5
"Gurhan's place was the perfect stay for visiting New York for a week! It is beautifully located just a 2mins walk from the Hudson river with amazing views of Manhatten skyline. Honestly a dream to just talk a short walk every morning with that view! Bus connections to New York were also super convenient and Gurhan was super helpful with instructions. What I appreciated most was that he treats the place really like a home - he also lives in one of the rooms which is why you get more than the bare minimum equippment like in so many other Airbnbs. It was always super clean, the flat is modern and rennovated and the kitchen is super well equipped. The rooms have super nice storage options to make the most of the little space which is great! It really felt more as if we were flatmates - with the additional benefit that Gurhan was always making sure that I got everything I needed for a perfect stay. He can give great recommendations for rooftop bars in NYC! 10/10 recommend!",5
"Everything was really nice! Host was helpfull and friendly, the room and the bathroom were clean!",5
"Great host, very warm and welcoming. The place was clean and all instructions very clear. Would recommend.",5
"Gurham was a great host! The bed was comfy and the space was perfect for a quick overnight stay. The location was perfect—right by the bus stop. That said, if you’re sensitive to light or sound while sleeping, there are a couple things to keep in mind. The foam wall separating my room (room B) from the other half of the bedroom was thin, so I did wake up when my neighbor came home and opened their door (it sounded like someone was opening my door, it was that loud). Generally, everyone was quiet. Also, the bedroom door has glass window panes that have been painted over with white paint, so if a neighboring guest leaves the shared living room/bathroom lights on it’s pretty bright in the bedroom. I had to turn it back off a couple times after I’d gone to bed (between midnight and 2am). That’s not a reflection or Gurham, so he gets 5 stars, but some things were less than ideal for me, personally. Gurham was very helpful and friendly, and the AC unit worked great in the warmth!",5
"Great place, great host great location. Only 25min from Penn station by bus. Many great restaurants. Host is very friendly",5
"100% recommended place to stay if visiting NYC, the bus to port authority (times square) is 3 mins walking from Gurhan’s place. I especially loved the bathroom, squeaky clean and has a bidet. The room is as described. Gurhan was also very responsive and super helpful",5
"Spotless clean!! The host was always responsive very helpful. Love the spot, beautiful views of the NY highlights. Bathroom clean and renovated, very modern. Big kitchen with lots of utensils. Bedroom small like the picture, but very clean. Would love to stay there again! Thanks Gurhan.",5
"Easy self check-in and entry/exit (passcode), clean common areas and great amenities. Gurhan is easy to communicate with and only on-site for routine cleanup. It's a 20-30 min commute to NYC (via NJTransit bus), and grocery stores/laundromats are accessible by foot and public transit. The location is steps away from a Hudson river overlook, and provides beautiful views of the New York City skyline. Overall very pleased with the experience; this is an excellent place to stay if your priority is affordability and a clean bed to sleep on. The rooms aren't huge, but they are functional and comfortable. So long as your neighboring tenant respects quiet hours, there are no issues with the styrofoam divider between Room B and C.",5
"I’m sure you’ve already read in other reviews how well-kept, quiet, and conveniently located Gurnham’s place is—all of that is absolutely true and matched my experience perfectly. But what really stood out was Gurnham’s proactive and thoughtful hosting. When I asked if I could leave my bags after checkout, he went above and beyond—calling the next guests to confirm their arrival time and allowing me to stay until just an hour before they arrived. It made my travel day so much smoother, and he still ensured his team had time to prepare the space. Incredible customer service. I’ll definitely stay here again!",5
"Beautiful, clean and cozy stay",5
"West New York was really a find! It's about 25 minutes from 42nd in downtown New York and you only pay $4.10 for it. Gurhan's Airbnb is very different. There is a drinking fountain with water, which is very rare on Airbnb in the US, where I almost always have to buy drinking water. Apart from other things like microwave, hot water, refrigerator, internet and so on. Gurhan is very nice and a very friendly and helpful host. I already told him I'm back next year. Translated from Portuguese Show original",5
It was my first time in NYC and Gurhan made it so much easier for me to get around. He gave clear instructions about the bus system. Also whenever I had a question he was super responsive and helpful. The place itself matched the pictures and it took only around 35 mins to get to the city. Another perk of the place is the view you are getting of the city 🤩 I can only recommend the place!!,5
Everything was great. Great value for money. The room is small but it does not really matter because the whole property is clean. It is at most 30 minutes by bus from Manhattan and the bus stop is almost right infront of the house. I commuted daily without any issue. Gurhan is also very responsive and extremelly helpful with luggages before and after check in and check out (you can leave them safely in the property).,5
"Nice place , I will highly recommend!",5
"The host was very nice!Responded to my needs promptly. The wheel of my suitcase broke. They actively helped me find tools and even gave me a suitcase. It's very clean inside. Although it's shared, everyone is very civilized and quiet. Recommended to stay! Translated from Chinese (Simplified) Show original",5
Excellent deal. The views of NYC from the Main Street. I mean WOW! Breath taking. Gurhan is a great very responsive host. The place has everything I needed. I just wanted a clean cost effective place to sleep and shower and I got that. Would definitely stay here again.,5
"Lowest price, a bus ride away into the main city which takes an hour but that's what you pay for. It's a great location for a single person and there's a bunch of convenience stores around with an ice cream shop that has some of the best ice cream i've had.",4
I had a quick trip and Gurhan was very accommodating and friendly. The rooms were very clean and the beds were very comfortable. The environment is very peaceful and there are great views along the river walk. I highly recommend and will be scheduling another stay in the future.,5
Mr. Gurhan’s place is perfect for solo travelers. Easy to find and great location. Public transportation is perfect. The place was also really clean. Easy checking and checkout. Would recommend 10/10.,5
"Great place to stay! Right next to the property, there’s an free outdoor workout area, perfect for those who enjoy exercising. Communication was fast and very helpful. The area has plenty of great restaurants—Chinese, Italian, and Spanish. For tennis fans, there are tennis courts right by the accommodation. Plus, there’s a bus stop nearby with direct buses to Manhattan for $4, so you can reach the city center in no time. Highly recommended!",5
"Great location, super close to the bus. Instructions were very clear and made it easy to find the place and get inside. Love that everything was a keypad so the check in was flexible",5
The place was pleasant and comfortable to stay. The room was clean and the bathroom. The bus at the corner makes it very accessible to reach Manhattan in about 20mins. There are local restaurants open late as an option and walkable.,5
Great place to stay and price is good. Nice and warm bedroom. Recommend if you are looking for quiet space not far from Manhattan. It's comfortable to use a bus from this location.,5
"Nice clean room and community bathroom. Bus stop just around the corner to go to the city. Walking distance to the Hudson River. Only thing is if you are traveling with larger suitcases , it will be difficult to bring up and down the stairs because it is a very narrow spiral staircase. But overall I enjoyed my time and would recommend !",5
"Very good quiet neighborhood. House is clean and secure. From the disadvantages I want to mention narrow, very steep stairs inside the house, so it might be difficult to move luggage upstairs. All other aspects of living were very good, as well as owner, who guides you through all steps smoothly and clearly. For this price I can definitely recommend this accommodation.",4
Perfect space for the price. Beautiful views of Manhattan and easily accessible to Manhattan. Lots of eateries nearby. Very quiet home and Luz was super communicative.,5
"The place is comfortable, clean, and well-organized, perfect for a worry-free stay. The location is convenient if you’re looking for a budget-friendly option not too far from the city. Luz provides clear and precise instructions, which makes check-in and check-out very easy. As a suggestion, it would be better not to be too insistent about extra charges for early check-in or late check-out, but overall the experience was positive.",5
Luz is so helpful and room is very clean. And location is easy to access nyc,5
It was really nice staying here as it was convenient to a nearby bus stop to get to New York as well as local restaurants near the place.,5
"Very good for the price! Got more than I expected. Nice room, not noisy despite other guests being next door. Easy and pretty fast to get to Manhatten by bus. Right next to nice view over Manhatten!",5
Excellent Place to stay if you are looking for a place to stay a little bit outside of Manhattan. I actually enjoyed the ~40 min into Manhattan bus rides with great views towards the its skyline. Nice large (shared) bathrooms. I hope to be able to stay in one of Luz’s rooms again.,5
"The room was larger than expected, immaculate, easy to find and incredibly peaceful. Location was perfect, right next to a huge park and short walk to beautiful scenic views of the city. Trader Joe’s and all the shops and restaurants you need right down the street. The bus from port authority drops just a block away from the room, making it the perfect stay to be “in the city” but stay just outside the city. Luz was an amazing host. Highly recommended.",5
Had a great stay at Luz's place. Lovely area and buses every 5-10 mins to New York. Bed and pillows was comfy and aircon was good. Place was clean especially the bathroom. Only negative was quite a lot of upselling of early check in/check out etc. However I was able to leave my bags for free,5
"Convenient location near a bus stop that provides quick access to Manhattan. Microwave and fridge are available for an additional fee, with reasonable prices. The only inconvenience, in my opinion, is the shared bathroom for the entire floor (5 rooms), so sometimes you have to wait. There’s also poor sound insulation — you can clearly hear what’s happening in other rooms, like the TV or conversations. Overall, it’s a great option for those who need to stay a few nights at an affordable price in a quiet neighborhood",4
"11 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · December 2025 It was a very comfortable trip while traveling in New York. I felt like a local on the commuter bus to Manhattan. Also, Luz answered my questions quickly and accurately. I would stay here again next time. Translated from Korean Show original",5
"Excellent host, and good location, very easy to get to Manhattan. In a matter of 20 minutes and the stop is next door. The value for money is pretty good for being in New Jersey. I think that if you're traveling alone, and your intention is to venture into New York, it can be a good option for a good price. Translated from Spanish Show original",5
"2 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · November 2025 Nice place to stay !! Peaceful and Beautiful surroundings",5
"I stayed there for a few days,and it was really good,it has very good connections with the buses and the zone is very quiet",5
Beautiful location and check in process was very easy. The host was always available for assistance.,5
"The place is excellent, just like the photos. Luz was super attentive and responded quickly, even when I ran out of internet and had to send her an SMS. The bus stop that goes to New York is a few meters away and for 4 USD, and seeing Manhattan while you wait for the bus is not to be missed. Perfect heating, the days were between -12 and -6 degrees. I'll be back. The only clarification, and it has nothing to do with the place, is that if you go with heavy and large suitcases, the staircase is a spiral staircase, but it is not an impediment, it will just take you longer to go up and down. Translated from Spanish Show original",5
Great value stay!,5
"The accommodation is located right next to a bus stop that leads to New York which is very convenient. The environment is peaceful and quiet away from the hustle and bustle of the city. The accommodation is clean, the bathroom is very clean too, I would recommend it. Translated from French Show original",5
"7 months on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · October 2025 It was a great value It was close to the bus, so it was comfortable to go to New York.I had a comfortable stay without lacking anything. Translated from Korean Show original",5
"Just a very small room, bed is really hard though. The little room with only one toilet does not have a lock which is weird. Otherwise the place is clean and conveniently a quick walk to the subway and right into Manhattan. The price wasn't too bad for what you get. The only downside was no air or fan, I sleep hot. But was not a bad air BNB.",4
"Lovely place. Victoria was very accommodating. Place is comfortable and clean. I arrived early and she allowed me to chill in the living room before the room was ready. She provides laundry services for a fee but was kind enough to do mine for free. Overall, very happy with my stay.",5
Host was very responsive that ensured the stay was comfortable without any hiccups. Place was clean & quiet.. has a nice common area if you’d like to sit & enjoy a cup of coffee Conveniently located 5-10min from a train station…,5
"Overall, the place was very clean and the host was friendly and helpful. I had a comfortable stay and am leaving very satisfied.",5
"Everything was very clean, and it felt very comfortable! The communication was very smooth, and it made everything easy.",5
"Great place to stay with walkable distance to the subway. I was able to get to Grand Central station in about 25 mins. Host was very responsive and the place has other guests as well staying in their own rooms. The entire house has a shared kitchen and living area. Only downside was the noise from the outside from cars passing by, which isn't really related to the property but just a heads up. Also, there was a guy outside the front door who approached me, thankfully I got into the property just in time but he stood outside the door waiting. Just be a little extra cautious. Overall, I enjoyed the stay and the price was well worth it. Host was accommodating.",5
"Fantastic location, walking distance to Queensboro Plaza, where you can catch pretty much any train or bus you'll need. Great pizzeria, bagel shops and restaurants all around, and the city is literally about 15 minutes from the front door. I look forward to staying again. Nice kitchen with almost anything you can think of, if you want to cook a meal.",5
"This trip, I checked in early in the morning, and Victoria were leave my luggage after I checked out, which was very helpful. Victoria responded to my messages very promptly. The location is a quiet residential area, but I could hear party music on weekend nights. However, I was fine because earplugs were provided. It was a bit disappointing that the windows didn't open, but it was a comfortable stay. Thank you!",4
"Had a good stay at Victoria's place. The apartment is convenient to multiple trains within a 10 minute walk. Lots of restaurants in the area, especially around Queensboro Plaza. The room was comfortable and it was easy to find the apartment. There's a bodega on the corner, and another 24 hour one not too far away. Quick train ride to Manhattan (less than 10 minutes). Would stay again and would recommend.",5
I had a smashing time at Victoria's. It was a quiet restful place but close to major connections. Everything was lovely; I bumped into the cleaner (my fault) she was so verysweet too. I would definitely use Victoria's again if I ever get back to New York. It was my first ever lifetime visit there and I would recommend everybody that I know and use her location again. Thank you Victoria. Lots of love Stephanie. Xx,5
"Overall good value! 10 min away from the subway station and runs along a Main Street so it felt safe even at night The only downside is that the room is facing the major street as well and, because there’s a window AC unit installed, the windows don’t close fully so there’s a LOT of loud traffic noise. Host provides earplugs but I was still woken up multiple times at night",4
"The place was clean and well maintained, the hosts were very responsive and nice. it was possible to leave the luggage both before the check in time and after the check out time till the evening, which is a huge advantage if you have an early morning or late night flight! A well equipped kitchen with tea and coffee was available for the guests.",5
Victoria’s place was very clean and well organized. It was a comfortable and convenient place to stay.,5
Great place. Great location. Great host. Would definitely recommend!,5
"Victoria’s place was close to Manhattan, walkable, convenient, and the rooms were kept very clean. The shared areas were very spacious and comfy.",5
Good price. I did not feel the other attendees. The location is close to the subway though i did expect a more lively neighborhood.,4
Walkable distance to different subway lines. Close to a lot of places. Very easy to find .,5
"room very convenient and comfortable, shared spaces cleaned and well defined. Metro easy to find",5
"Definitely worth the money! - clean, straightforward, basic amenities. And the host was super kind! All around great stay",5
"Had a lovely time during my stay in NYC! The room was super clean, the bed was comfy, and the rest of the apartment was full of various amenities (tea, coffee). The host was also responsive and helpful. Highly recommend staying here!",5
"best Airbnb, you feel like home, perfectly clean. Victoria clean the appartement every day, the smell is so good, the room is so comfortable, cozy and warm. Victoria prepare all small needs, believe me better than hotels . I will comeback soon with my daughters",5
Enjoyed my stay. What you see on here is what you get in person. The room as well as all common areas are kept very clean. If I ever come back to the area I’d have no problem staying here again.,5
"The house is in a pretty quiet street in Queen's, not far from all the attractions of multi-ethnic Astoria and five minutes walk from a subway line into Manhattan. Everything was clean and in a very expensive city like New York, it was very good value.",5
"I had a great stay. The room was very comfortable, and homier than it appears in the photos. It had a big window that let in lots of daylight. I had a great night's sleep both nights--no need for the ear-plugs Zuleide provided. The place is well-maintained and cared for, and expectations are clear. I appreciated the large kitchen, dining table, and lounge area. I wouldn't hesitate to go back and hope I have the opportunity. Thank you, Zuleide and Victoria!",5
Somehow even in the city it was so quiet and cozy. Bed was comfortable and the space was extremely clean. It was easy to find my way back and close to the subway. I felt extremely safe and the host was always checking in to make sure I was okay and ask if I needed anything. Would definitely stay again.,5
"Adi (Alfred) was a wonderful and responsive host. The apartment was clean, quiet and exactly as described. The bed was comfortable and there was a cozy, warm, common area for light meals or resting. Proceeds from the rental go towards the community soup kitchen that Adi runs and we happily volunteered to help one morning (though there was no pressure to do so). Location was fine but it is in the Lower East Village, so plan transportation/time accordingly for your activities in midtown/Central Park area. Lovely stay. Will stay again.",5
"Comfortable , clean apartment with such a nice host ! Loved having breakfast and coffee in the mornings . And the bed was super comfortable. Just an all around great stay .",5
"I LOVED staying at Alfred’s Airbnb. Alfred and Adi were attentive and communicative. The place was quiet, private and the bed was very comfy. The back garden was a lovely place to have a morning cup of tea or coffee. I would 100% stay here again the next time I visit NYC solo. The location really can’t be beat.",5
"Great stay! This was a peaceful place to return to after a long day of exploring the city, close to the 2 Av metro stop. We appreciated the opportunity to contribute to feeding the homeless with our stay and only wish we could’ve stayed long enough to volunteer! The listing says the bedroom door doesn’t have a lock, but ours did and we felt very safe!",5
I had a great stay at Alfeds place. He was a very accommodating host and made sure I had an enjoyable experience. I highly recommend staying here and I will definitely be back on my next trip to NYC.,5
We stayed with Adi for the New york marathon weekend. His place was lovely and in such a great location. We enjoyed being away from the tourist area to relax before the race. The garden the room access to the kitchen was all so relaxing and made for a perfect day.,5
It was a very nice and cozy place with a beautiful garden access. The location was very convenient for us and it was very quiet at night. There are two bathrooms and no wait. We were also able to lock the room with a room key. Adi was very kind and helpful. We’ll be back!,5
"Had a lovely stay at Adi's place. Very clean and comfortable, with a calm and welcoming ambience. In a great neighborhood with lots to see and do. Adi is kind, communicative and responsive. So nice to know that my stay contributes to running the soup kitchen and providing a respite for people from all walks of life. Having lived in NYC for most of my life, I highly recommend this place for visitors wanting to experience the broader range of ""real NY"".",5
"Alfred's place was very clean and fairly quiet, considering it's located between very busy streets. Our room looked out on a garden patio which had beautiful flowers and small trees. The room had sufficient space for us. The beds had nice sheets and pillows, with extra lightweight blankets in stored in the closet (nights got cool). There was good lighting in the room. I really appreciated how clean the two shared, full bathrooms were. We didn't have breakfast there but you could get started for your day with what is available.",5
"Great little airbnb with a good location next to the subway station. Perfect for a few days, apartment was cleaning and living space is great. Recommended!",5
"14 years on Airbnb Rating, 3 stars , · December 2025 Loved helping out with his hot meal program for homeless and disadvantaged people. Really friendly group preparing and distributing the meals. Alfreds place has a calm ambience and my room was excellent. Unfortunately while in the house no one talked, the other two residents when at home stayed in their bedrooms. It made me feel like I was intruding on their house and I felt very uncomfortable especially with the man (Richard). I tried sitting in the small and pleasant lounge a coupke of nights to read and have a nice herbal tea, to relax and hopefully chat or meet the residents. Unfortunately that never eventuated. While I liked Alfred's house, and he is a lovely person, I thought about moving out early.",3
"Cozy spot with a nice garden in close walking distance to lots of spots in the East Village, Bowery, and NoHo. The host was very communicative and I didn't run into any issues during my stay. During a really hot July week in the city, this was a nice quiet first floor spot with good AC to come back to!",5
"Cozy and serene spot to stay in Manhattan. With a zen courtyard garden and windows away from the street, I was able to enjoy an oasis of quiet, a cup of tea, fruit and simple vegetarian self serve options for breakfast. Would 100% stay again. I was headed to a meditation retreat afterwards and this spot was perfect for that transition. Thank you for a lovely stay!",5
"My son and I felt at home here. It was peaceful, comfortable and the hosts were very friendly. This place is a great East Village location just a few blocks from the 2nd Ave Subway station & Bowery Whole Foods. Lots of great restaurants around & very walkable neighborhood. We are looking forward to visiting again someday! I highly recommend staying here.",5
"My daughter and I thoroughly enjoyed staying at Alfred's home in the East Village. Communication was excellent and Adi was even waiting for us when Uber delivered us from La Guardia. Our room opened out onto a garden area with lovely flowers. We had fresh fruit, quality breads, and cereal everyday. We were given much flexibility in leaving our luggage safe after checkout time and before our flight. We would definitely stay there again.",5
"Would highly recommend - great location in the middle of everything, but on a quiet street with a nice garden, very clean, and a great price. Two shared bathrooms so it’s never limited access, thoughtful selection of things to eat for breakfast. Very accommodating about check in and check out times. All in all, we had a wonderful stay.",5
"If you're staying around NY, this is the place to be, with a compassionate, loving and caring interfaith community. Always ready to help you in any possible way and with a purpose you can engage with, volunteering with them. If I get the chance to come back again next year, I will try and check their availability. Eskerrik asko = Thanks for everything. Namaste and blessings",5
"We had the best time! The apartment was beautiful, very clean, and located in an authentic area where everything was within walking distance. The owner was very nice.

"Mel is a perfect host. She is very helpful. Whenever I needed help and sent her a message, she always responded quickly and gave me a hand. Her house is very clean, and I especially want to mention the kitchen. It is well equipped with many tools. Mel even provided an egg boiler, which I really loved. The transportation is very convenient. If you want to visit New York, you just need to cross the street and take the 156 or 159 bus. The fare is $4.10 per person. I would definitely book this place again if I plan to visit New York in the future.",5
"Great stay with Mel, really lovely neighborhood and cheap parking. Gotta be careful where you park though, make sure to follow Mel’s instructions. Rooms were very clean and well stocked with all the necessities. Bed was very clean and cozy, AC in the room was great. Overall great option for a trip to the city.",5

"Second time staying at one of Mel’s properties. She’s really responsive which is great! Extremely comfortable bed, very clean bathroom. Heads up: noise travels in the apartment so if you’re a light sleeper bring some earbuds. Overall, I’d stay again.",5
"I had a great stay at Mel’s place! The space was clean, comfortable, and exactly as described in the listing. The location was convenient and made getting around really easy.

"We stayed for 3 nights. Our first night was a very late check in and there were no problems with this. Instructions to get into unit were great. Mel was very communicative and helped us on a few occasions with transportation. Provided great instructions on the NJ bus and NJ light rail. We were satisfied with our stay. Home was clean. Other people also renting air bnb we had some common areas but, while we were in the home we never ran into them. Would recommend.",5
"It was a very comfortable stay. I liked the location, parking was a little tricky but Mel explained everything very well. Room was very warm and comfortable.",5
This was a great option to stay at in North Bergen. Very close to the busses to head into NYC. Clean space and great communication. Would advise.,5
Parking is an issue. But its a great place to stay at! The host is also very responsive and helpful! I really enjoyed my stay.,5
"Mel is a very responsive and accommodating host. The check-in experience was very smooth as I could leave my luggage for holding early. Very accommodating when I needed the room to be cleaned more frequently. When the bedroom door lock stopped working, Mel was very prompt in offering a nicer location to stay in while also tending to the repairs immediately. Would highly recommend staying here.",5
"Had a one night stay here and it was very spacious, convenient, and comfy!! Very detailed instructions for check in too!",5
"Responsible host, very clean and easy to find, though need to spare 40 minutes of travel time with bus to NY",4
Mel was very responsive & understanding… every information given was so informative & detailed…. reccomended if you want to go to NY… you can just go to the Bus :),5
"This is a great deal for what you pay for and expected for a shared common space location! The walk and location was awesome. There are some really great bakeries and cafés nearby. Lots of food as well. And close to public transportation. I came here because my sister lives in five walking distance from here so it was extremely convenient Many home the upstairs basement. Depending which room that you rent, the shared space is different. Basic amenities provided which was great (toothbrush, towels, loufahs, coffee pods, basic cooking supplies etc). The actual room was nice and private, was a tad musty because I came during humidity season, but once I turned on the AC, all was good :) I had an instance where we ran out of toilet paper, but after communicating with Mel, it was resolved within hours — fantastic communication. She was so responsive! Would definitely recommend people coming for a short or affordable stay to rent!",5
"Mel's place in North Bergen was safe, clean, and had easy access to transit into NYC. Mel is very helpful and responsive. It was easy to stay at Mel's place.",5
"Mel is a great host, always has a good response in a good time, the place is clean, organized, and there's plenty to do around it. I'd say the only tricky part is parking; it's not very accessible. Thank you Mel!",5

"its a perfect place to stay, i really loved my stay here . its near the bus station and the neighborhood is safe and has a beautiful view to new york 🤩, i ll come here again. thank you michelle for your kindness",5
"I think Michelle's place is the best choice for people who want to save money for lodging. She was very responsive and super helpful especially when I asked her about the shortest route to get her place. The only thing I was disappointed was that the bedding was a little bit stinky. However, since I didn't expect a hotel-quality here, it was tolerable for me. Other than that, everything was clean and just perfect! 9.9 out of 10!",5
Michelle is a kind and responsive host even late at night. The place is perfect for a short stay,5
Michelle was always responsive to my inquiries. It’s the best place to stay if you are on a budget while in New York. Less than an hour to Manhattan. Quiet neighborhood and i had comfortable stay.,5
"4 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · February 2025 I really enjoyed my stay in Michell’s place. She was very responsive and her Husband Joe was helping whenever I needed anything. Worth paying the money. What I liked most about is her clear instructions about everything. Including how to get to NYC and back. I will definitely stay next time.",5
"As with Michalle, I imagine an Airbnb if you want to stay well and inexpensively. New York was reachable in no time. The area is nice for walking. The place was exactly as described and I was even able to without any problem and with consultation from Michelle. We'll definitely see you again. Translated from German Show original",5
Definately thinking about coming back of visiting NYC.,4
Good location and responsive host,4
It was very good because it was easy to get to Manhattan and cheap to stay.The view of Manhattan from the bus was also very beautiful. Translated from Japanese Show original,5
love the location. slightly too expensive for an old house.,4
"Great location, easy to find and walk to bus stop to New York is only 10 minutes. Host is friendly and responsive.",5

All good,5
She was super sweet ! Definitely recommend!!,5
"I had a lovely stay at Michelle's house. The bus stop to New York is only a short walk away, the neighbourhood is quiet and peaceful, the house is very clean and a great value for money. The room was very warm despite cold December temperatures outside. Michelle is a lovely host, she's super helpful and answered all my questions promptly. Overall, very happy with my stay, thank you 😊.",5
"this was a great stay however we couldn’t find the living space mentioned (possibly could’ve been our fault) we didn’t necessarily need it so it wasn’t an issue at all. very comfortable & convenient all around, there was some loud music but that’s expected. our only issue was the outlets in our room shut off but she quickly helped us solve the problem.",4
"Michelle’s place was perfectly located and we truly enjoyed our time in NYC. Michelle was also helpful at all times and incredibly responsive. We were 5 minutes from Times Square and the ACE line. You share the bathroom with three other rooms, so there is a bit of traffic going in and out. It was also incredibly loud at night so definitely bring headphones or use the provided earplugs. It was a good stay for the price.",4
"This place was perfect for a quick stay in the city. Close to time square but far enough away to get some sleep. Very clean. Small, but had the essentials. Perfect for my boyfriend and I.",4
"The place is very well located with lots to do around. There were stairs and it was hard to go up with my luggage. However when I left a very kind young lady, part of her staff, helped me with my bags. A suggestion for Michelle: please offer a couple of bath towels and a face towel. That would have been nice. I would have paid more for that. Check out was at 11:00 am, Mario was very accommodating allowing me to keep my luggage in until 2:30pm. I had a great stay! Thank you Mario and Michelle.",4
"Michelle’s place was just perfect for my quick little getaway. Because I traveled alone I wanted something right in the middle of all of my activities and also easy to access the subway. All of the above were meet. Loved how easy the check-in was with everything being smart home, I didn’t have to worry about remembering any codes. The place was so cute just as listed! I felt completely safe and Michelle was also very reassuring and answered any questions I had which gave me even more peace of mind. I will definitely be coming back and booking with Michelle! Any girls out there looking for the perfect spot to visit all the attractions and best transportation options, I definitely recommend this. Oh and a little tip and bonus was that the Uber airport shuttle is $20 and drops you off in the same block where this is located! But wait there’s more! If you use Bounce to hold your luggage is right around the corner! Seriously cannot get any better! Thank you again, Michelle!!",5
"Michelle did a fantastic job of making her place feel like a home away from home. The place was clean and tidy, with a good assortment of amenities to ensure a comfortable stay. The decorum was very cool and quirky and with this in mind the place is aptly named! As a host, she was very helpful and responsive. It felt like there was always someone on hand if I needed help. This was also a really great place to stay in a vibrant bustling area. Perfect for an active city break! This was my first time in the city and if I return (highly likely) I will certainly consider staying here again :) Thanks for a great experience!",5
Michelle was amazing with responses! Very helpful and let us drop off bags early/pick them up later due to flight times! Very helpful and would 100% stay again.,5
"This was my first time in New York for a very quick stop (not vacation) and Michelle was extremely helpful with subway routes, answering questions, etc. It was also my first time only booking a room with a shared bathroom situation. My room was clean, cool as soon as I walked in - which I was so thankful for, and the bedding and sheets were very soft and comfortable. My room window was closest to the street & there were some loud people at night, but it didn’t bother me & I was still able to go to sleep. The price point was a big factor for my stay & budget. I would absolutely book again.",5
"Michelle was so helpful and the room was just as described! The location was so convenient and less than a 15 minute walk from where the show I came to see was. Also the place was around the block from a major subway station, so that was super helpful as well.",5
"Michelle’s place was awesome! Great location, very comfortable bed and linens, clean and a really nice large tv. Michelle is a great host and responds quickly to any questions you may have. I highly recommend staying here!",5

Great host. Perfect place and matches all description. Highly recommended.,5
I had an excellent stay here! Very close to Times Square and to the subway as well. Felt safe & well accommodated. Would definitely recommend! :),5
"10 years on Airbnb Rating, 4 stars , · July 2025 Michelle place is great for someone who wants to be at walking distance from times square and central park. There are good eating and coffee places near by. The room is well kept and comfortable. If you are ok with the various surrounding noise then its a good set up ..Overall had a good stay.Michelle's place is a gem for anyone eager to stretch their legs and meander to Times Square and Central Park. The local dining and coffee spots? Chef’s kiss! The room itself is tidy and cozy, like a warm hug after a long day of exploring. Just a heads up—if you're not a fan of the occasional New York symphony (a.k.a. city noise), you might want to bring some earplugs. But hey, if you can roll with it, you’ve got yourself a fabulous setup! All in all, a delightful stay!",4
It was pretty close to a lot of places and easy access to public transit. Room came as pictured!,5
"Great stay. Check in was easy, place was as described, just was noisy since you’re directly at the front.",4
Michelle is one of the best hosts I have ever had. Extremely friendly and always willing to help. Highly recommend staying here as I will again.,5

it was exactly like how it was listed!,5
Very easy to find and check in tv was nice bed comfy shower good too!,5
Cimen and Ozgur are lovely hosts and I enjoyed staying in this spacious room. The area is very well connected to transport to NYC (recommend taking bus over Uber/Lyft to save money).,5
"Cimen and her brother ozgur was amazing , always responsive and super polite. They invited us for food and drinks and they made us feel like we were home . I will definitely book this place next time i am visiting new york , definitely worth every penny.",5
I really enjoyed my stay at Cimen’s place! The hosts are lovely and very accommodating. The connectivity to the city is great and the room is exactly as described. I’d highly recommend this place!,5
Check-in was smooth. Got the walk-through. Felt like home. Had an excellent stay.,5
Cosy room! Neighborhood can get a bit loud but usually gets quite by the time it’s night.,5
"We stayed at Cimen’s place during our East Coast road trip, and it was such a charming, quaint retreat just outside NYC. Everything was perfect, and we’d happily stay here again!",5
"Staying at Cimen and Ozgur’s place was such a peaceful and heartwarming experience. The atmosphere brought a beautiful sense of nostalgia, quiet, cozy, and surrounded by a beautiful town with a wonderful view on the skyline. Everything was clean, well-maintained, and felt incredibly safe. What truly made the stay special were the hosts themselves. Cimen and Ozgur are super friendly, kind, and always ready to help with anything you need. You can feel they genuinely care about their guests. If you’re there to relax and disconnect, this place is perfect. Highly recommended for anyone looking to unwind and recharge in a lovely environment.",5
My room was wonderful and super comfortable and cozy and I felt right at home here and I had a great time. Cimen and her brother have always been super helpful and never hesitated to help me out or lend me a hand. They were very welcoming and kind. I stayed here for over a month so I can definitely recommend long stays. West New York is a great area with little cafes and restaurants and the view to Manhatten is absolutely amazing. The Bus stop is near and it only takes 20-30mins to Manhatten. I always felt safe here. Even at night the Bus from Manhatten to WNY was always full and people are very warm and kind here in general. There is a nice park near and you can use different buses to visit different areas in NJ. I recommend „Little Japan“ in Edgewater which is just 20mins from the airbnb I think this is the perfect spot if you‘re looking for a cozy and calm space and don’t want to be too far away from the city. Would always book here again!,5
amazing and cozy place to stay!,5
"Very close to many bus lines directly to Port authority terminal, right beside times square and metro lines, perfect to visit the city",5
value stay!,5
"Hosts were very responsive and friendly. The location of the house is excellent, very close to New York. There are buses that take to NY every 10 minutes at the price of $4, and the route lasts about 15-20 minutes. The house is very cosy, it has a well-equipped kitchen and the room is very large and comfortable. I recommend it! Translated from Portuguese Show original",5
"A great host who welcomed us even after midnight. Decent housing at a reasonable price. Great travel accessibility, 5 min walk to the bus stop (runs every 10 min) which will get you to Manhattan in 20 min for $2.80. Right next to the house there is a 7eleven. The house is a little older, which you can see, but for the price you pay, it's a great offer. I recommend Translated from Slovakian Show original",5

"For my first big travel experience this place was the perfect option! Very clean and safe, and the room we stayed in was comfortable making the night back after all day in the city wonderful!",5
"We stayed here during a severe cold wave in New York, and there was a serious problem with the heating. The room temperature dropped to around 7–8°C (mid-40s°F or lower), which felt unsafe. We were repeatedly told that the heating system was “fully controlled” and that guests must not touch it, and that “there should be no problem.” However, the room never warmed up. The bedding provided was only one very thin, summer-style blanket per person. When we asked for extra bedding, we were told it was not necessary and that “comfort depends on the person,” and that additional blankets would cost $15 each. Even those were very thin. Because we had a minor with us, we asked again and only one thin blanket was added. It was so cold that we had to sleep wearing down jackets. There was no space heater or any alternative provided, and at one point we were even warming our hands with a hair dryer. On the coldest days, we genuinely felt it was unsafe and had to move to a hotel. Only after contac",2
I really enjoyed my stay! Really cozy apartment and host is amazing! Whole experience was friendly and place is located in the great neighbourhood!,5
Very responsible and attentive!,5

"2 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · October 2025 🇺🇸🗽There is a convenient bus stop near New York and a good breakfast cafe nearby. The bathroom, living room, and kitchen were shared, but the host managed them well, so we were able to receive consideration. I was glad that the shower was upgraded. Thank you for the good service. Translated from Korean Show original",5
"J's place has everything shown in the listing, extremely clean, easy access, super nice area, quiet to relax after overwhelming visits to NYC, transportation literally around the corner, very convenient. It has a beautiful view of the city, a 3-minute walk or less, shops nearby. The other tenants weren't annoying, in fact we never saw them. We would definitely stay again. It's totally worth the price, it's fair. It met our expectations. Translated from Spanish Show original",5
"4 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · October 2025 The location was so nice, and everything in the room was clean! Water was also provided and everything was good Translated from Korean Show original",5
"We had a wonderful stay, and we were pleasantly surprised by the location of the Airbnb: bus 3 min walk, which leads to Port Authority / Times Squares in 25 min (count $8.20 round trip, as it is the NJT network). The cleaning, whether in the room or in the common areas, was impeccable, and the bedding was also very comfortable, and the room was quite large! We did not use the living room or kitchen, but at first glance, they seem very well equipped like the whole apartment. If you need anything or have a problem, the hosts have always been responsive to find a solution. We highly recommend these hosts and this Airbnb, it's great value for money for NYC!

"Amazing place, great hosts, unbeatable views, I want to stay there!!! Translated from Spanish Show original",5
It was a nice time we spent there and there was nothing to complain about. They always answered us quickly and well when we had questions. Translated from German Show original,5
"Area was peaceful after away from the city. Public transportations is always available, except if you wanna stay out until after 12 am on a Friday, probably be ready for taking an uber/taxi from the bus terminal at Midtown. Other than that location was good for the cost, also surrounded with cafe, restaurants, laundromat and other things. Lastly, Mel and her team is very responsive, resourceful and helpful during to our stay.",5
"Clean. Great location. Easy to find. Only upset was the noise from tenants or other airbnb guests coming from the rest of the house and outside in the driveway. There seemed to be children which is totally fine but they were very loud until a late hour & after a long day surrounded by people it just wasn’t very peaceful for us. Otherwise, I’d totally stay again.",4
"The host was excellent and communicated/responded very quickly! I had no issues with the place and all the necessities were readily available! Even with the cold temperature outside, the place inside was incredibly warm!",5
The place was exactly as described and had everything one would need for a stress free stay with lots of local shops and resources within a comfortable walking distance. The host responded to inquiries with lightening speed and made everything clear and easy.,5
"Nice place, very comfortable, and Maahi was very quick with responses. The only issue was that at one point the door seemed to open on its own, but other than that everything was great. Overall, the place was very nice and we enjoyed our stay.",4
"Very average, but great for the price, the people upstairs are loud sometimes and the lights would randomly flicker on and off, the door lock was also a bit werid, the owner came buy and fixed it but when we woke up in the morning the door was slightly open, its seems like the lock on the door was not installed correctly and with good force you can push the door rigth open when its not locked so that was a bit weird hopefully they can get a better lock",5
We had a wonderful stay very clean and cozy room we had great time and any concerns we had were addressed nothing major a little warm but we sent a message and all was accommodated.,5
We booked this place last minute for our trip to NYC. Very easy drive back and forth. We enjoyed our stay here and would stay again. The room was cozy and provided all that we needed. The only thing is that it was hard to find street parking when we got back from NYC in the evening.,5
"I had a great stay at this studio! It was very clean and exactly as described. Communication with the host was excellent—they were quick to respond and really helpful. Overall, a great place to stay and I’d definitely recommend it.",5
"Great stay! The booking matched the photos perfectly, and the home was in a fantastic walkable scenic area. Check-in and check-out was a breeze, and I really appreciate being able to share the driveway. Communication with the host was smooth and responsive throughout our stay. I’d definitely stay again!",5
"Perhaps a few more water bottles could be provided. The air conditioner was satisfactory, although this may have been due to the weather during our stay; it is unclear how it would perform in hotter conditions. The addition of coffee and a coffee machine was a good idea. We were also pleased with the cleanliness and comfort of the beds. Thank you.",4
Very great hosts! Very responsive and accommodating as well as considerate! I am thankful for them helping me with a last minute stay while waiting to return home during the winter storm of Jan 2026. Would totally recommend booking with Maahi!,5
"Maahi’s place was super clean and exactly like the photos. On the beds there was just thin sheets, but we found a better duvet in the cupboard. Maahi and Mel communicated good and quick and everything went well. They gave us a later check out as well, which was super helpful. The bus stops are close by and you get a beautiful view of Manhattan on the way there. The only thing was, that we couldn’t get the door closed. It didn’t stay closed well and we didn’t get it to lock. They tried to instruct us, but we didn’t get it to lock. It was a bit scary but all went well and we had a super good stay! Would def recommend!",4
"I had an amazing stay! From the moment I booked, the hosts were so kind, responsive, and genuinely accommodating. They went above and beyond to make sure I was comfortable and even made my special requests happen without any hesitation. It honestly made the entire trip so much easier and stress-free. The space itself was clean, cozy, and exactly as described — even better in person. The location was convenient, the check-in was smooth, and I felt completely taken care of the entire time. I truly appreciate how thoughtful the hosts were throughout my stay. I’d give this place a full 10/10 and absolutely recommend it to anyone looking for a great Airbnb experience. I would 100% stay here again!",5
This is a room in a house on the first floor by the entrance so you can hear everybody walking in and out. The room also got too hot in the morning but otherwise the place is great and easy to get in.,4
"Absolutely amazing Airbnb and host! Communication was key from the beginning, the Host answered me really fast, was super helpful and answered every question i had. When we arrived she helped us figure out a parking situation, which is a huge plus. Even tho it was late. The Airbnb was amazing! Super clean, good equipped and had some goodies like loofas, body wash and more. Even water! Probably one of my best stays so far. I‘d definitely stay longer next time. There’s a view of NYC near by too! Thank you for the great stay!!",5
Our stay was amazing! We were able to catch a baseball game in New York and got some good food near the house aftwrwards. All the shops and restaurants were within walking distance. Mel was very responsive and answered all of my questions. Will definitely be staying again!,5
I loved the set-up there. It was like being in your own hotel room with a touch of home. The host was very responsive and answered all my questions. I would definitely come back and stay again.,5
"Great Airbnb for one night. Me and my friend came for a concert it was in a great location. Very clean, easy to find, and cheap street parking. Great place would recommend!",5
"When I say my stay with my husband was amazing. We had such a wonderful stay! The place was exactly as described—clean, cozy, and very comfortable. The host was amazing—friendly, responsive, and made sure I had everything I needed throughout my stay. The location was perfect and made getting around super easy. I would definitely recommend this spot to anyone looking for a great stay and this is our 2nd time staying here. Already booked our 3rd stay at another unit they have listed. 😊🤗",5
"Great location, good communication, and very clean place! Definitely would recommend it :)",5
The coziest airbnb. Exactly how it was described. Pretty spacious. Maahi and Mel were extremely responsive. The place was peaceful and very accessible.,5
Staying at Maahi’s place was very easy and nice! She was flexible with the time we checked out too. Would stay again!,5
"Maahi let us check-in early at 12:30 pm and was always quick to respond. Place is 8 minute walk to bus stop that goes to Port Authority Bus Terminal in NYC in 30 minutes. Street parking is $10 for 24 hours, buy daily parking pass at same location as bus stop. Wish it had a microwave but grateful for mini fridge and paper plates",5
"I wanted to start off by saying thank you to the host Yusuf, left very clear instructions before arrival and left me a very friendly, polite welcome. When i arrived everything was like how pictures described and showed wich made me feel comfortable and happy. I can say this homes is real peace and i will definetly be revisisting again🙂‍↕️😍very happy with my stay:) also the view to the city is spectacularrrr😍",5
"Since booking to check out Yousuf went above and beyond, super attentive and helpful. And the apartment was amazing! Super clean, it had everything we needed and more. Great location, parking and beautifully decorated, STUNNING! We have stayed in many AIRBNB's in New Jersey and by far this one is the BEST one! We'll definitely, without a doubt, be staying there next time we visit.",5
"7 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · December 2025 , · Group trip Our stay was wonderful! The airbnb is beautiful and looks exactly like the pictures listed. It’s in an accessible location, very close to many restaurants and bus stops. Yousuf was an amazing host! He was very attentive and welcoming. Check-in was extremely easy. He was great when providing help and information on public transportation in the area to go into New York City. I would definitely recommend! Hoping to make another trip back!",5
"I had a great stay at Yousef’s place! The space was clean, comfortable, and exactly as described. Check-in was easy, communication was quick and helpful, and the location was very convenient. Yousef was a thoughtful and responsive host, which made the stay even better. I would definitely stay here again.",5
Really enjoyed the view of Manhattan from the living room and the gas fireplace. So close to the city and so quiet inside the apartment. We slept great. We will be back!!,5
"Belchertown, Massachusetts Rating, 5 stars , · December 2025 , · Group trip Just returned from a perfect little NYC get away with my family of 5. The space was perfect for us. With the provided air mattress and large sectional couch, my 3 teenage boys each had their own space to sleep. It was clean, had everything we needed, and checking in and out were super easy.",5
Lights out…one of the nicest accommodations we have ever stayed. We were celebrating two of my littles bdays and they both had the time of their life. Thank you so much for being such a fabulous host with such an amazing apartment!,5
"My stay was great! Me and my daughter stayed for her 10th birthday. We both loved how the apartment looked just like the photos, beautiful! We felt right at home and safe. Comfortable bed and couch! Spacious and clean apartment! Yousuf was just as great, friendly and quick to respond. Such a good host! I would definitely stay again! Thanks Yousuf!",5
"Yousuf’s place was Great. Just like you see in the photos. Very nice open space, kitchen and a beautiful view of NYC skylines from the living room and bedroom. Private parking was a plus, easy check in using the instructions he provided, building is really secure and area is quiet and clean. Checked in late a little after 10 pm and I was still able to find stores open in the area to grab things I needed.",5
"pretty perfect, very clean, such comfortable bed and couch, will definitely be back here, having a safe parking spot and secure place to stay was just what we needed and were looking for. thank you for such a great place",5
I had a fantastic stay! home was spotless! beautiful decorated and exactly as described! Highly recommend staying here! You won’t be disappointed. I’d gladly book again🌟Thank You!,5
"We loved our stay at Yousef’s place. It was quiet, clean, and an easy to get to the city and back. We would highly recommend to anyone wanting serenity close to the city, but far enough for peace and a great stay!",5
"We really enjoyed our stay at Yousuf’s lovely apartment! It was exactly as described and shown in the pictures — clean, cozy, and very comfortable for our family. The location is perfect if you want to visit New York by bus, with easy and convenient access. The only thing we’d mention is that there are no blackout shades, which can be a bit tricky if you like sleeping in total darkness. Other than that, everything was absolutely perfect. We’d definitely stay here again and highly recommend it!",5
"Miami, Florida Rating, 5 stars , · October 2025 , · Group trip The stay at Yousuf’s place was amazing! The unit was as described and the pictures are 100% accurate. Very clean and well organized. Yousuf is a very hospitable host who checked in periodically to ensure we had all we needed during our stay! Will definitely stay again! Thank you",5
"Everything was perfect, we had no issues. We are grateful to have stayed at Yusuf’s. He provided us with the instructions and the home was beautiful. Very nice view of New York from window at night. Thank you for sharing your home with us!",5
"Yousuf’s place was just as described in the details. It was easy to find from the airport. Coming back in n out of the city to the apartment made it feel like home. Very quiet neighborhood. Yousuf was very responsive and helpful whenever I reached out. We would probably stay in the city next time mostly likely, only because we have our kids with us and taking the bus transportation from there and back is very hectic if you’re not familiar with the bus routes. But it’s a perfect spot for an adult vacay stay away from the city. Would definitely recommend this property.",5
"A great place to stay, only a few minutes to a bus stop and an easy ride into the city. Also a quiet neighbourhood with a little deli around the corner for small food and drink purchases. The apartment also had a great view of the city and looked fantastic at night.",5
"Really great place, very nice and clean, easy to get into, have your own parking and only a 15 min drive from NYC, My family and I loved staying here , we will definitely stay here again.",5
Yousuf's place looks better than the pictures. It was easy to check in and the place was pristine. He was also very communicative and I highly reccomend his place. I'll be staying here again. Thank you Yousuf.,5
This was such a pretty Airbnb! It looks just like the photos. My daughter and I had a great time celebrating her sweet 16. We took the ferry to the city and it was the most beautiful view of all of Manhattan from Harlem down to Wall Street.,5
The place was really nice. Had a great view of New York City skyline and was clean and well kept. I had no problems connecting with the host and overall the stay was really great.,5
Omggg this design of this apartment is absolutely beautiful. Even though I was there for a day I felt right at home. Yousuf was very sweet and accommodating. I wish I was able to stay longer. 💕,5
"Absolutely loved our stay! The place was spotless, stylish and in a perfect location. Check-in was seamless and the host was incredibly helpful. Would definitely stay here again!",5
Stayed for a night and it was aesthetic and clean. Great view of Jersey City from the windows. Host was responsive and kind. The place looked like the pictures :),5
"2 months on Airbnb Rating, 4 stars , · January 2026 Good location in New York for my first time there. Could walk everywhere. Amenities were all good. It being Christmas time, there were a lot of sellers on the street just outside of entrance and made sidewalks crowded. The heating struggled a bit on the days that were really cold and snowing. I had some issues Christmas Eve and staff still helped on this busy night.",4
"11 years on Airbnb Rating, 4 stars , · December 2025 Great value for the location. The biggest plus is that it’s right in front of the subway, making it super convenient to get around NYC. Rooms are small, as expected for the area, and the surroundings can be noisy, especially at night. If you’re prioritizing location and price over space and quiet, this is a solid option.",4
"We had the best time! We loved the hustle and bustle of the city. The location is great, walking distance to Little Italy and Chinatown, and little shops and cafes. The Subway entrance was just outside the door. Canal Street is very busy with street vendors and somewhat noisy, but to be expected and we enjoyed it!",5
"This place was convenient to a lot of spots in lower Manhattan/Chinatown. It was roomy for two people and easily accessible. It is in a part of the city that has heavy foot traffic and noises so if you are a light sleeper, maybe not the best spot, but they provide earplugs. Communication is great and check in was easy! If you're just going out to explore the city, definitely recommend!",5
"It is very conveniently located, and it was fairly quiet. I slept well in a comfortable bed. It was rather expensive for the quality of the lobby and neighborhood, but that is to be expected for Manhattan. I was, however, quite satisfied to have a good comfortable rest in the midst of a very busy and exciting city. Vincent",4
"There was no microwave or refrigerator. You had to go downstairs to warm up you food but would you even want to if you can refrigerate it. They did have a communal refrigerator if you trust it. The lobby where they had the microwave and communal refrigerator was nice, clean, welcoming however if you don’t wan to have to get dressed up and/or socialize too early in the morning you would want a microwave or refrigerator in your room.",4
"Excellent place. There is a subway entrance when you exit the hotel. The room is exactly what you need if you are traveling (I went with my girlfriend and we thought it was excellent). The hotel is in a very strategic area for shopping, because all of Soho is close to you (Alo Yoga, Lululemon, North Face, Target, TJ Maxx, etc.) I would definitely come back. It is the best price/quality option if you visit New York.",5
"I mourn the days when I could use Airbnb NYC to stay in someone’s cute place, but this exceeded expectations in terms of being clean and safe and — at this price point — having my own bathroom. My only complaint is the 10 AM checkout time. You can request extension, but I wasn’t aware of this within the 12-hour period (that’s on me). I had a spacious room AND bathroom with shower. Location was excellent.",5
"My experience at the hotel was short (only one night), but impeccable. The room had everything that I needed, and although they couldn't check me in earlier, they were always sending me messages with feedback. The place is somewhat noisy (the room was on a 2nd floor on the Canal St front), but I could sleep very well. The room is really small, but complete. I'd definitely stay there again. Thanks for eveything!",5
Everything is perfect! The host is soooo kind and he cared everything for me. The room is not so big but very clean and comfy. I recommend this place in the center of NYC.,5
"Great view, good price for NY, clean room and very clean bathroom. Good location, room is sufficiently large for NY, very helpful staff. Only issue is that the microwave / toaster oven didn't work but that's not really their fault. Would recommend, 5/5.",5
"The room was mostly as advertised. There was an issue with the thermostat in my room. The heat was at 83° even though I had it set to 70°. Still, worth a small inconvenience for the price.",4
"The check in and check out was easy, and location was close to a lot of great eats and easy access to subways. However it is far from luxury. So if you’re looking for a fancy New York stay I’d definitely pay the extra funds. This is an affordable stay.",4
The room was super cold at night and using the thermostat did nothing. The chair was dirty and there was tons of dust on the bed. The wall had tons of holes and the bathroom was clean. The floor was dirty with visible stains. I had encountered a suspicious male at 5ish am on the lobby while there was a worker watching and I went up the elevator fast. I heard a knock 2 minutes later and it was the same guy pacing back and forth down the hallway. Be careful when you’re returning to your room. Photos of booking didn’t match room,2
"Desk worker was very helpful and understanding, always willing to assist. Room perhaps a bit smaller and less cozy than the cover picture, but mostly just a result of having a corner room. Area was dense, busy, a bit sketchy, but easy to navigate and very convenient. The first night, there was a small but noticeable wafting smell for about ~20-30 minutes; not sure what it may have been, but did not seem characteristic of the hotel at all. Very worth the price, although I did receive a discount.",4
Me and my hubby stayed here for our anniversary staff was very sweet it was easy to check in I had a great time for the couple of nights I stayed neighborhood was nice and quiet during the day streets were busy but accessible to the subway and to SoHo will stay here again for future trips :),5
"12 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · January 2026 Excellent value. Quality room, nice folks running it. Bustling Canal street on the doorstep, close to great eats in Little Italy and quick access to multiple subway options.",5
"We enjoyed our stay at the hotel! It was like described. The photos look a little different because of the different room options, but still clean and tidy. They were very helpful and responsive. They provide extra amenities at the front desk and also an extra charging cable! We also like how convenient the location is to get to different places, there’s also a lot of people and traffic right outside. We heard some noise from our hotel room but not too bad, since it’s expected when we’re located within the city.",5
"Great location for the price. The view from the hotel window is not particularly impressive, and the photos are somewhat misleading—if you are looking to enjoy a city view, this is not the right place. However, if you simply need a comfortable place to stay while exploring the city, it is a great option. Public transportation is very convenient, Chinatown is within walking distance, and Times Square is about 20 minutes away by metro. There are also plenty of restaurants and street food carts just a minute away.",5
I really appreciated that the door was code locked so no one can just barge in and the room was pretty small but if your coming to travel its perfect because your not going to be sitting in the room all day your going to be out,5
"We really enjoyed our stay! It’s the perfect locations, clean, and tidy. Very safe. Although there are many street vendor infront but it’s not disturbing at all. Would definitely comeback",5
Good value for what you pay. Staff was very good. Can be loud but honestly wasn't that bad. Room was a little smaller than expected but was decent. You get what you pay for :),5
"The hotels location was very good. There is a subway station directly in front of the hotel, providing excellent connections and making it easy to reach everything quickly. The staff were friendly and helpful. Overall, a pleasant stay. :)",5
"The hotel reflects what is described. The room is very basic but has everything you need for the stay. The main issue was that the room was quite cold, and some drafts came in through the windows. However, the hotel provides a heater.",4
"All the staff were friendly and cordial. The room was very clean and matching the pictures. Nice and warm and cozy with a comfortable bed. I liked having my own personal sink in my room since there was a shared bathroom. The shared bathroom was no problem either, never had to wait for it. Thanks to the hosts and the employees I will be back again next time.",5
"This was a great place to stay! It was easy to take the subway and just a few minutes walk from it. The host was professional, and prompt when asked questions. The room was clean and clutter less along with the rest of the areas. The toilet and shower are literally eight steps around the corner of the room we stayed in. We will definitely be staying here for our next visit!!",5
"We really enjoyed our stay. The room was more spacious than we expected and just the right size for two people. The shared-area snacks and drinks were super well stocked, and the host was really kind. The location was also very convenient. The only downsides were that the shower pressure was a bit weak, and there was a rattling noise at night, maybe from the heater. Other than that, everything was great!",4
Great stay! I appreciated how clean the room and bathrooms were. I think it’s rare to find a place that is well maintained and clean. I definitely preferred this to one of those Sonder type airbnbs. There was an actual person in the building at the front desk at all times and it felt very safe. I also feel like they take cleanliness and maintenance very seriously. They are also very friendly and it was easy to leave my luggage for a bit before and after checkout.,5
"We had a wonderful stay! The location was great, space was very clean, and the breakfast was greatly appreciated. They even allowed us to leave our luggage after check out while we explored the city because we had a later flight. Definitely recommend 🙂",5
"Wow - what a charming place in my fav Chelsea Manhattan . Stayed a few nights for Christmas , amazingly people and co. , coffee and scones , etcetera to say the least-ish … warm nice vibes and special places",5
"This was a great deal! Someone was available 24/7 for check-in, and they were very kind. We did not mind the shared bathroom as we only shared with 2 other rooms besides ours and could easily walk to the next floor if needed. It was a great value for us!",5
"Great location, great people, great price, the rooms and shared amenities are very clean, the hosts are extremely welcoming and nice! Plus they provide some ingredients for breakfast in the morning which I loved!",5
"I will definitely stay here again, it's a clean, affordable room in a great location! Very difficult to find in NYC (impossible actually). No issues with shared bathrooms, if my floor was busy I could go to another floor. Alex was very responsive whenever I had a question. I am also a big fan of their mission to help others. Thank you!",5
"This is a very special and accessible spot in an otherwise overpriced area. Additionally, I really love that there is actually someone there to meet you when you check in! The whole experience felt warm, community centered and safe. I stayed with them during the early months of the winter, and they were having some difficulties with managing the heat in the building (too hot). Even so, they were very responsive when I expressed any needs — and I assume that they will get the heat situation (old building with radiant heat) figured out soon.",5
"Great spot, welcoming staff, clean room, nice garden to sit outside, chin up bar, and vegetarian breakfast stocked in the kitchen. I’m happy with my stay, would recommend.",5
"We had a wonderful stay. Our hosts were very friendly and welcoming, and even let us choose our room when we got there. We would definitely stay with them again, and recommend them to anyone looking for a nice, inexpensive stay in Manhattan.",5
For a stay in lower Manhattan this was more than sufficient. Comfortable and easy check-in and the place is well-maintained. The people working there are friendly and easy to talk to.,5
"Awesome room, great neighborhood. The hosts were super friendly and communicated really well.",5
"The place was clean and was just like the pictures, private room with shared bathroom. Front desk attendants were very helpful and welcoming.",5
Had a great stay- would stay again! Baggage holding was super helpful and host was extremely accommodating.,5
"We had a wonderful stay! Super clean, accessible location, and extremely kind hosts! We would recommend anyone staying for a weekend to try it out!",5
"My husband and I stayed in one of the queen-sized bedrooms for 4 nights and had a great experience. Alex was very accommodating to my request for a room on a lower floor that was due to an ankle injury. Everyone we interacted with was very friendly. The photos and description matched exactly with reality and everything was clean / tidy, including the shared bathroom and shower. The location couldn’t be beat - walkable to so much and close to several subway options. If you are a light sleeper, I would recommend ear plugs or even noise canceling headphones as there is a fair amount of noise from people coming and going (which is to be expected) and it’s an old building with little insulation (totally normal for NYC). Other than that, it really did feel like a tranquil space in the chaotic city!",5
"Great location, warm feeling and very hospitable with the breakfast area. Neighbors were a little questionable.",4
"Awesome location, perfectly clean room, the shared bathroom was rarely occupied, shared common spaces were very clean. 10/10 would recommend!",5
"needed to arrange a last-minute overnight stay, and this worked out great for me! Reasonably priced for a very nice, clean, comfortable room to spend the night in. I really appreciated Alex's helpfulness and attention – when I first stopped by my room I was a bit nervous to find it quite hot (as they're still figuring out the heating during their first winter in the building) and was worried I wouldn't be able to sleep well that night, but Alex made sure to get the AC going and check that the room cooled while I was out for the evening. I came back to a perfectly cool room where I slept like a baby :) I very much appreciated the thoughtfulness! Thank you for a lovely stay.",5
"We had a great stay in Chelsea. Cute room, friendly staff, and free bagels and toast for breakfast. I wish I'd booked a room on a lower floor- we were up four flights of stairs- but as I told my kid, hey, in New York, you need to do a lot of walking. It's nice to find a place equivalent to the old Seafarers house on Union Square: non-profit, reasonably priced, and with a social mission. Rooms are very clean, simple, and cheerful.",5
"The room was pristine and comfortable. My worries of a bathroom in the hall were unfounded - easy peasy right outside our door. Sink in the room was good - it could use a cup for drinking water and tooth brushing, but that's all I have to suggest. As an Airbnb hostess I know what to look for and what I hope to find. This place was terrific.",5
"12 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · June 2025 I really enjoyed my stay, everyone was friendly and helpful. The room was lovely and peaceful. Even though I shared a bathroom and shower - which was the deal and the price is adjusted accordingly - I never ran into anyone and it was always available. The location was amazing - a charming New York street, very quiet and yet walkable to a lot of great restaurants, near the High Line, a couple of subway stops from Broadway.",5
"This stay exceeded all expectations. The host was so welcoming and kind, and the area itself was a perfect 10/10. Even though you’re in the heart of the hustle and bustle, your room will not be noisy. Hospitality was outstanding and made the experience feel very personal. I left not just happy with my stay, but with a new friend as well. Ivy is truly the best ever!",5
"Really cozy pad in an insanely convenient location for midtown Manhattan. Clean, quiet, comfortable. Next time I’m back in NYC this will be the first place I check, you get the rare better experience than a hotel for less money, it’s a great deal, wish there were more places like this around Manhattan but there aren’t so grab this one!",5
"Ivy was extremely friendly and kind, he made it feel like a home away from home. I felt safe and cared for as a guest, but I felt treated as a friend rather than a guest. The place was spotless and accessible, worth the price and I would definitely come back again. The place is in reach of everything and it is a very safe area to stay in if traveling alone. I would recommend this place to anyone that is wanting to get a cozy and warm feeling of home away from home. Very content and pleased with my experience. Thank you for the lovely hospitality!",5
"I 1000% recommend this location to anyone looking to travel solo. As a woman traveling to New York for the first time, I felt right at home immediately and very safe. The entire place is just as seen in the photos, pretty and well kept Inside your own room there’s an A/C which is really convenient. The location is right in the heart of everything and accesible trains right up the block. The host was very warm and welcoming and also gave great recommendations for food/drinks and activities.",5
"Really enjoyed my stay at Carlos's place. Wonderfully and thoughtfully done up. Very comfortable. Terrific location for access to food and so many things to do right nearby. I loved being able to walk around Manhattan and especially Hell's Kitchen from this location. There's so much to discover right in the neighborhood. Carlos went out of his way to make me feel at home, relaxed, and comfortable.",5
"A warm , cozy, refreshing stay with the a very friendly and equally warm host . It was my first stay in New York and my host made it worthwhile . I’m glad I picked this as my stay and I would love to do it again in the future . All the famous spots around manhattan is nearby and walkable . Lots to eat around the area and it was super safe .",5
"Perfect place for anyone traveling to New York. The hosts were responsive and welcoming, they gave a lot of great recommendations, made the stay very peaceful and their attentiveness was superb. The Airbnb is spotless and clean and the decoration made me feel so relaxed and right at home. Would recommend this to anyone. The hosts do a great job and keeping their place beautiful and comfortable for your visit. Would definitely stay here again!",5
"What a great stay! Absolutely lovely host. So welcoming and warm. Beautiful apartment. Spotlessly clean, comfortable bed, nice shower and linens. Location was excellent!! I will definitely stay here again for future solo trips to NYC.",5
"The place is beautiful and cozy. I felt safe. It’s so conveniently located I pretty much walked to all the places I was interested in visiting. The host is incredible, kindhearted and attentive. I highly recommend.",5
"Very clean, comfortable, and has everything you need. The hosts are very thoughtful and friendly. Bed is on the soft side, so beware if you prefer a hard mattress. Great location.",4
"I was charmed by both the host and the apartment from the moment I walked in the door. Super friendly and easy to chat too. He did a great job setting the mood for a visitor. From offering fresh watermelon when I arrived to playing “hit the road again” music as I was packing up, I’ll look this host up again no doubt.",5
"If you’re doing some solo traveling definitely a fantastic spot to stay at, Ivy was phenomenal and made sure I was taken care of the whole trip. They definitely know how to create a nyc experience, very happy with my stay!",5
"4 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · January 2026 The interior is stylish and very clean, the hot water works well, the living room is very spacious, and there is nothing to complain about",5
"OMG the beds are soooo comfortable!! I need to know where he bought his sheets and pillows. Carlo’s place is small, but that’s expected in NYC, but comfy. Small little touches, very clean, and overall lovely. Had all the amenities we needed.. perfect place for a quick visit. Carlo was quick to respond to any questions. I will definitely book again.",5
"The space is a bit small for 3 persons, but it is at a very convenient neighborhood. The room is very clean and chic, we can tell the host has good taste. However, before the check out date, the host asked us to bring our own garbages to the basement which we don’t actually quite understand since we paid for cleaning fee… Overall I’d recommend this place to stay at the heart in NY.",5
"Carlos (Eduardo's) place is exactly as described: NY style small, very nicely decorated and very central. It has everything you need, great bed, warm shower, fluffy towels and good wifi. It is noisy (bedroom window streetside) as was expected so bring some ear plugs if you are a light sleeper. Lots of nice restaurants around 9th avenue. Communication was good and quick. I would definitely recommend.",5
"I stayed at this lovely Airbnb for three days and truly wished I could have stayed for my entire trip. Ivy and Carlos were incredibly kind and welcoming, which made the experience even more special. Their check-in instructions were clear and detailed—especially helpful in downtown New York, where everything can feel a bit overwhelming at first. The apartment was spotless, beautifully organized, and thoughtfully prepared. Even though the neighborhood is lively with traffic and city energy, the space itself felt surprisingly quiet and peaceful. As anyone who visits New York knows, space can be limited—but this Airbnb offers enough room in both the bedroom and bathroom to move comfortably without feeling cramped. With so many amazing restaurants just steps away, the location couldn’t be better. I would absolutely stay here again and highly recommend it to anyone visiting the city.",5
"I had an amazing stay here! It was my first time in New York and this experience was so much more than just an Airbnb stay. it truly felt like home. On top of that, Ivy’s stylish interior design, cleanliness, and service were all at such a high level and very professional. Eduardo always replied quickly and responsibly, and Ivy was so warm, friendly, and caring. And I really enjoyed every conversations. When I wasn’t feeling well, Ivy made dinner for me, and even the cleaning lady made me homemade soup! Thanks to all of them, I was also able to experience the diverse and energetic culture of NY. If you’re visiting NY, I truly recommend this Airbnb. I’d love to stay here again. Thank you so much for all your kindness and warm hospitality!💛",5
"The place was in a convenient location and comfortable, making for a great stay. Carlos was friendly and helpful, which I appreciated.",5
"Carlos is friendly and is always there to help. The room was clean, organized and my stay was comfortable!",5
"Apartment was comfortable, spacious, clean, with well thought-out design. Excellent and plentiful amenities. Carlos was an easy to communicate with and hospitable host.",5
"3 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · May 2025 Carlos is very helpful when I told him my flight got delayed. He is super responsive and friendly. The bed is very comfy and the apartment is clean. I would def come back to stay here in the future.",5
"Carlos was a kind and excellent host. Very responsive and attentive to all our questions and special requests, like late checkout. His apartment is stylish and comfortable, perfect location if you're in NYC for Broadway shows and is even walkable from Central park.",5
"Carlos provided thorough, helpful instructions. Even so it was a bit difficult to get in because the keys required a knack I didn't quite pick up. However, the place was very clean, well appointed, smelled pleasant, and matched the description. Quarters about as tight as you'd expect, but the available space was used well. And you can't beat the location: super convenient to the subway, lots of dining and entertainment options, though you'll need to wade through crowds after shows close. Carlos was a thoughtful, responsible host with a great place. Worth it!",5
"I had a lovely stay at Maria’s airbnb. The bedroom was cosy & clean, and although the apartment is shared with another guest bedroom and the hosts, it was very quiet at night and I had peaceful sleeps. My only downside was that the local buses into New York from the apartment are infrequent and unreliable so it would take about one hour to commute each way.",4
"The host was very friendly from start to finish. We shared a few laughs and drinks, which made the stay feel very welcoming. The rooms were clean, the place was quiet, and there was easy access to public transport to Manhattan.",5
"4 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · November 2025 Easy to commute to manhattan by bus. Maria is very nice and responsive! She provides detailed information about how to take buses, which is very useful! Bathroom and kitchen are clean. Quiet and peaceful neighborhood.",5
"Our stay at Maria and Alex’s place was amazing! The flat was super clean, cozy and had everything we needed. The location was perfect, really easy to get into NYC near Times Sq with 1 bus but still quiet and relaxing at the end of the day. Maria and Alex were both really kind and welcoming, and it was great chatting with them during our stay. They genuinely make you feel at home. Would 100% stay here again next time we’re in the area!",5
"Very friendly, easy to communicate with her. responsive, place was clean and she was very helpful with giving recommendations and instructions on where to go. I love the cats.",5
"This was definitely a great stay at a great price, nice neighborhood, kind host family, it's all very convenient for a traveler. Maria was very supportive and provided some needed tips for navigating the NJ bus system. I was very pleased. Also, such sweet cats.",5
"Really enjoyed my stay, Maria is really sweet and a place was really clean. I would definitely recommend staying with her.",5
"Maria’s place was comfortable, clean, and quiet. She was friendly, helpful, and responsive. Check in and check out were both very smooth and simple. The neighborhood felt safe and many stores and restaurants were a short walk away, though I found traveling to and from Manhattan often took much longer than was stated in the listing.",5
Maria and Alex are the best hosts you could possibly get. They made me feel at home. They are super friendly and helpful. It was a pleasure for me to stay in their flat. Thank You Maria and Alex for letting me live my New York dream in the best way possible. Thanks for everything you did for me. P.s I will miss Junior ( the best cat ever).,5
Maria was so accommodating and kind to us during our stay! Would definitely rebook with her!,5

"Maria was so warm, kind, and responsive! The bed was also really comfortable and everything from the bedroom to the kitchen was super clean.",5
"Maria is an amazing host—very warm and welcoming. The place is spotless and exactly like the pictures. Her two cats are adorable and such a joy to have around. Overall, a wonderful stay! Definitely recommended.",5
During my stay I was invited to hang out with them as a group and they were incredibly homely and fun to talk to!!! I'd recommend if you want to stay in the area and are familiar with the public transit options it's a great choice for price.,5
"This place is exceptional, it's a perfect example of how an airbnb should be. Maria and Alex went above and beyond to insure my stay of a few days was as comfortable as possible. The place itself is very clean with all the essentials provided. The hosts are extremely friendly and welcoming. The bus stop to New York is just steps away making it convenient to ride to the city. Overall a great experience and would highly recommend for anyone visiting to explore New York city.",5
Alex and Maria was very Kind. Maria was always very helpful and could answer any question. It was a really great stay. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was very clean.,5
"i really don't want to share info cuz i wanna keep this place all to myself ;) maría & alex were wonderful hosts & extremely hospitable, their place was thoroughly immaculate, and i felt like i was home... i WILL be back. thank you!",5
"Maria was a wonderful host..always helpful and responsive. Her place was just as described in the photos, and very near everything, shops, restaurants, bus stops. As a 1st timer in NY, I totally enjoyed my stay ans will definitely be coming back!",5
Great stay! Very lovely and cozy place with a couple of cutest cats!! 100% recommend!,5
A wonderful host. Welcoming and would ask if I needed anything throughout my stay.,5
I really enjoyed my stay at her place. She is wonderful and very available. The space it’s clean. I recommend her Airbnb.,5
Maria was very prompt and the place was as described. I loved it,5
I enjoyed my stay at Maria's place. Maria was very helpful is answering my questions and was also responding as fast as she could. I would recommend her place to anyone visiting New York. .,5
"I had an absolutely wonderful stay at Maria's home! From the moment I arrived, I felt incredibly welcomed and comfortable. Maria and her husband are a truly outstanding hosts – her hospitality and treatment were exceptional. The home itself is lovely, and I was particularly impressed with how incredibly clean everything was, especially the bathroom! The location is excellent, making it super easy to get into New York City. Having bus stops so conveniently close by was a huge plus for getting around independently. I highly recommend Maria's place to any traveler visiting the area. I would absolutely love to stay here again",5
"This is a small but comfortable room in an apartment on the Upper East Side, conveniently located for lots of restaurants and museums, with a subway station one block away. Great as a base to explore New York from.",5
"Amazing location and great value for the price! Just note that it’s a shared space with very basic amenities, more like a hostel-style stay. If you’re okay with simple and affordable, this is a good option. Huimin was a great host!",5
"Great place to stay in NYC! Walkable neighborhood and easy to get around the city. Min was very responsive and thorough with check in instructions. Note address is not the same as listed on Airbnb, but Min was quick to clarify how to get to the actual location in check in instructions.",5
"Perfect stay for a solo trip! Hardest part was getting my luggage up the 4 flights of stairs but it was worth it for the price. Huimin was FAST to respond with any questions I had which was great. I may have had another roommate but I never saw them and they must have been quiet. I had trouble with the keys at first but realized I was using the wrong one the whole time so that was operator error. Walking distance to restaurants, grocery stores, subway, the Met and Central Park. Would stay again!",5
"There was a slight debacle with the address that was listed being incorrect, but luckily it was handled fairly quickly. After that the experience went great. Love the location. Quick walk to Central Park and a very nearby subway station.",4
"13 years on Airbnb Rating, 4 stars , · October 2025 Excellent location. Huimin was helpful with assorted issues over getting keys to work. The small room was fine though the building is aged and the bathroom quite tiny and under pressure when four people were trying to use it this morning. NY is expensive so this was an acceptable option if you don’t need bells and whistles.",4
"I will plan future visits based on whether this airbnb is available!! Great instructions, great deli down the street, close to a lovely park but still just a 20 minute subway ride to Broadway.",5
"Huimin was so responsive and helpful! The place was neat and cozy and at a great location, honestly worth every cent. Thank you Huimin!",5
"Quiet, clean space in a great location. Very responsive host. Highly recommend if you are passing through NYC.",5
Incredibly clean and as described. Very close to many great restaurants and the Q line. Would definitely stay here again!,5
"Min’s place was exactly as listed. I did have to carry my bags up 4 flights so be aware but it’s NYC, what do you expect? Check in instructions were very clear and the neighborhood was a nice location with close proximity to a subway station. Lots of great restaurants nearby - I definitely recommend the new speakeasy Zofia’s Hideout just next door. Overall I definitely recommend and would stay again.",5
"I felt safe walking in the surrounding neighborhood in the evening. The instructions for checking into the building and identifying your room was very straightforward. The building locks are a bit old, so it did take a few tries to get those doors unlocked, but the room door was much easier to open. Bathroom was a bit dated but still organized. There were other guests in the unit, and they were all pretty quiet. Overall, a good value stay.",5
"It is a charming place, in the middle of lots to do, easy in, easy out, instructions were clear. My phone died as I arrived, but I could remember some of the things Min wrote, and the rest were obvious - the right lockbox, which key for which door, all worked smoothly. I’ll stay again when I return.",5
"The place is in disrepair. Heater cover fell off, no outlet covers, very poor water pressure. The apartment is subdivided so this room has the heater for what was meant for the living room & kitchen, meaning it is super hot. It also means every time the room next door opens or closes its door the wall the bed is on shakes. The address the host listed on the Airbnb webpage is different than the address the host actually provides to you.",2
"Absolutely wonderful place. Great area, affordable, comfortable.",5
"I had a good short stay. Just a note, Airbnb gives you a different address then thr one provided by the host.",5
Huimin was a great host and very communicative. Space was great and easy access to the subway and into Manhattan. I would definitely come again!,5
"I love the location of this place , is a small room like how the description says but is very Nice and theres a/c as well. :)",5
"The apartment, shared with two other guests was perfect for my short stay. Though the apartment was small (like most in New York) and shared, I hardly saw the other guests and everyone was quiet and respectful. My room was private with a lock on the door. And the fan I needed was readily available right in the room. A new looking Air Conditioner was also installed . Though the room was small, there were two windows in it that looked out to a court yard and tree and it was very quiet. I heard some pigeons cooing right outside the window, a sound I like. Anyone with mobility issues should probably not rent this apartment, however. To open the lockbox, one has to kneel or squat to reach it, and the apartment is on the 4th Floor in a walk-up. The host was readily available which was reassuring since locks in old NY buildings can be finicky, but her instructions with photos was very helpful and I accessed the apartment without much difficulty.",5
"I agree the photos are edited to make this place seem better than what it is. The building, apartment, and furniture are in need of repair. I stayed in the small room and it was just okay. Plug covers were missing, questionable stains. Even with directions, the place was hard to get into (keys/door knobs took force to turn). Huimin was very responsive at all times. The biggest gripe was the apartment being on the 4th floor. There are no elevators in the building whatsoever so keep that in mind for those with luggage. Overall, would not stay here again.",2
"A great value stay a few blocks walk from Central Park. Lots of nice restaurants and bars in the area, and Yorktown is well connected via the subway for those looking to travel into midtown Manhattan.",5
"You get what you pay for with this property but it’s great for a few nights in the city. Be aware that to get to the bathroom and kitchen you do have to walk past the person sleeping on the signed, which I wasn’t expecting, but the location right next to 86th st station and the Q Line is perfect.",4
"Location is great, building quiet & secure (old), accommodations as shown in pictures. 3 keys for building-apartment-room each different on the ring so easy to use. Room with twin bed has nice windows that open, bed ok, extra bedding for range of temperatures. Didn't use kitchen, others did. Sharing one bathroom with 3 strangers worked better than I expected. The person on the sofabed is sleeping right outside the twin bedroom so need to be ok with that. Instructions for check in and check out clear and easy.",4
"Min was extremely responsive and I appreciate that. The professional photos of this place make it look much more maintained and brighter than it actually was. It would more accurately be described as a hostel. There is another bedroom and sofa bed in the space that other guests will stay in. The room I stayed in had a heater that could not be adjusted. It was horribly hot (even with the window open) with no thermostat in the main area that I could find to adjust. Again, for the price I realize you get what you pay for. Just wanting others to go in prepared.",3
"Sandra was a lovely host, the house is on a calm block right next to the subway. It has plenty natural light and is setup quite aesthetically. Sandra is friendly, responsive and understanding. Would love to come back when im around!",5
"Ms. Sandra was an absolute breath of fresh air and a wonderful host to stay with during my first visit to NYC. Not only was she incredibly polite, but she was also very welcoming. Due to severe weather conditions I was able to request an extra night of boarding immediately and Ms. Sandra was very understanding and accommodating. She also offered me a vest to stay warm as I came unprepared for the New York weather as a delusional visitor from Alabama. The space was clean, quiet, and the house rules were incredibly simple to abide by. As a woman traveling alone for the first time I felt very safe with Ms. Sandra as my host and she made a significant effort to make me feel comfortable. I highly recommended her home and appreciate her kindness greatly, and I know where i’ll be staying the next time I visit NYC.",5
"My stay at Sandra's house couldn't have been better, the room was perfect for one person and even though the floor can accommodate like 5 people, I only shared with one guy that was very nice and respectful. Sandra was flexible enough to accommodate to my needs, I even asked to reduce the incense because I'm allergic and she did right away. She also was so kind to let me stay way after the check out time since my flight was at night. I would definetely go back to this place on my next trip to NYC. As a note, the room is 2 floors up through a narrow stairs, so just take into account if you have big luggage like me. Also the house is only 40 min from midtown, so convenient, and I arrived late at night with the subway and didn't feel unsafe at all. Thanks Sandra!!!",5
Sandra s accommodation was peaceful nd all kinds of stores nd public transport is few minutes away,5
"Beautiful old victorian mansion, full of character and very clean and tidy. It made me feel directly at home (which I find to be quite rare). The single room was perfect and full of character like the rest of the house, with a fully equiped kitchen just for the guests and a spotless bathroom. Sandra is a super host who looks after her guests, is easy and nice to talk to, communicative and knowledgeable on the area. The neighborhood is nice and safe with beautiful mansions lining the streets and many restaurants and small eateries. The Subway ride to Manhattan is an easy 30 min or so. And the station is conveniently located around the corner. I hope to come back!",5
"I would definitely recommend booking to stay here. Sandra is so friendly and welcoming, she really made me feel at home. I was very grateful to be upgraded to the larger bedroom which has air conditioning. The room was lovely, very comfortable bed, which was needed after lots of busy days exploring New York! It was great to have use of the upstairs kitchen for snacks and drinks. The house is ideally located just 2-3 minutes walk to the Subway station.",5
"Sandra was a wonderful host. The room was just right and felt like a private section of her home. The environment was quiet, and everyone was respectful of personal space and belongings. Just need some ac. Loved it though!",5
"I had a great stay at Sandra's home. Good public transport connections into Manhattan and beyond, and some nice spots nearby for food and drinks. The accommodation was clean, kitchen was well stocked, and it is as described in the listing. I'd stay here again when I'm back in town.",5
"I stayed at Sandra's home for 11 days while preparing for an important exam, and it was exactly what I needed. The place is peaceful, clean, and very comfortable—perfect for focusing on studying. It's also in a great location, just a 2-minute walk to the Q train, which takes you straight into the heart of New York City. There are grocery stores and other essentials nearby, making everything super convenient. Sandra was a thoughtful and responsive host, and I really appreciated her hospitality. I’d absolutely stay here again!",5
"Sandra is a fantastic host, very friendly and knowledgeable, and her rooms are immaculately turned out. Everything works, the amenities are there, and it’s a very comfortable place to be. I felt at home right away.",5
"Sandra was a very gracious hostess. The house is an adorable 3 story townhouse in a very quaint side street in Flatbush Brooklyn. I grew up in Manhattan, but I’m not that familiar with the neighborhoods of Brooklyn. If I were younger and hadn’t moved to Florida, this would be a neat place to live. The subway is only a block and a half away and you’re about 40 minutes to midtown Manhattan and about 20 to Coney Island. The only negative thing I could say was that my room was very tiny. I’m 6 foot two and I felt very cramped. I would love to rent from Sandra again, but I would take one of the bigger rooms next time. For a petite female it would probably be perfect.",4
"Highly recommend staying at Sandra‘s house. Sandra was very welcoming, helpful when I had questions. But really she had made instructions so clear to begin with that I didn’t have too many questions. The house has a very calming quality to it, which makes it perfect for a New York stay. I really did feel right at home from the beginning, and that was important to me, because New York is such a beautifully hectic city, and it was really nice to come back to some peace and quiet at the end of the day. ☺️ The room and the common areas were very clean and inviting. All in all day was so charming and home-y, and I hope to be back myself one day. Oh, and the subway stop is right by the house. So convenient. 🤭",5
"7 months on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · 3 weeks ago Perfect location and wonderful host!",5
Sandra was very welcoming. She is very nice and I can’t wait to come back.,5
"Sandra is an attentive and wonderful host. Her entire family is helpful. The accommodation is located in a safe, quiet, and green neighborhood. The house is directly adjacent to the subway tracks Q and B. There are three rooms of varying sizes on the second floor, which share a bathroom. Two face the street with early sunrises, and one is at the back, facing the train tracks, like the well-equipped kitchen. Sandra is generous and loving, and she wants to make your stay as comfortable as possible, providing every amenity. Unfortunately, I had bad luck with the extremely hot temperatures in the very small front room, despite the provided fan. That was unfortunate. The other larger and beautiful rooms, especially the rear room, seem more suitable for hot weather.",5
"My week at Sandra’s place was perfect! I didn’t know what to expect in the neighbourhood but I loved the surroundings and the vibes of the Flatbush area. Sandra and her family are very polite and welcoming, people with great energy. I had my private place to work remotely, which was quiet and peaceful. I was able to cook my meals and use the kitchen, which was ideal to keep myself on my diet. There’s a gym nearby that accepts temporary plans with no contracts (and the owner is super friendly as well). There’s also a big park a few blocks away. There are other guest rooms in the floor but honestly I did not see much of the other guest and had no problems sharing the same bathroom. The laundry place is right by the corner of the street and I was able to do my laundry easily. I will always have good memories of my stay in Brooklyn and I expect to come back to Sandra’s place in the future some day. I can only appreciate her hospitality and the kindness of the people from the region.",5
"11 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · March 2025 I loved my time at Sandra’s house. I felt right at home. And with it being the first time visiting the US I’m so grateful I chose such a safe place to first land. The room is cozy. The bathroom and kitchen clean and easy to use. The location is great for solo travellers. You have everything you need locally - food stores to cook at home and restaurants/cafes to eat out if you like. And the train station is only a minute or two walk away so getting home late at night alone felt safe as well. Manhattan is about a 30 min train ride which did not bother me at all. It was nice to be able to go into the city when I wanted to and then be in a quieter suburb for sleeping. Catching the subway was a novelty being from Australia too so it never got old! Sandra was also very helpful with communication and directions. The room, kitchen and bathroom is on the top level so you have plenty of privacy. I would definitely recommend staying at Sandra’s place.",5
"What can I say about Sandra (100 sheets)? This wonderful host who takes away the loneliness of visitors during their stay. This wonderful person who welcomes you, accompanies you, guides you, and advises you. It was a huge pleasure for me to stay at Sandra's and highly recommend anyone wishing to visit NY, more precisely Brooklyn, to book her place. Looking forward to seeing you again while waiting to hear from you. BAH. B Translated from French Show original",5
"9 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · November 2025 The location of the accommodation was close to subway line Q, so it was convenient.

"Sandra was a superlative host and went FAR above and beyond making my Father’s first trip to New York City both memorable and pleasurable. I first booked this trip over a year and a half ago for May of 2024. Unforeseen circumstances forced me to delay the trip by a year and Sandra was patient and understanding while I sorted it out and rebooked me for the stay a full 12 months later than the initial intention. Additionally, due to a change in the NYC Air Bn’B regulations, she was forced to cancel my reservation while the paperwork was sorted out. During this ordeal, she was also extremely helpful as she gave me a refund but held my time-frame until it was possible to resubmit my deposit for the room. I am very grateful for this degree of courteousness. Upon arrival, she was so friendly and welcoming and this meant a lot as my Father is a pensioner on his first foray across the Atlantic and does not speak English. He could not have felt more at home in his accommodations as it was very",5
"Beautiful, classic house with many characteristic elements from more than 100 years ago. Atmospheric/warmly decorated with a clear personal touch from a particularly friendly Sandra. Thanks to the silent fan above the bed, it was wonderful to sleep despite the heat. Kitchen and bathroom excellently equipped, the only downside was the absence of a coffee machine or perculator. I would go back to this address on a future visit. Translated from Dutch Show original",5
"I couldn't dream of a better place to stay during my trip. Sandra was a very kind and flexible host, the house had a peaceful atmosphere and had everything mentioned in description. The neighbourhood was lovely, safe and only 2min walk from the metro station. I will not only recommend but also be back !",5
"Staying with Sandra was a great experience, pleasant, quiet and undoubtedly left a taste of more. The communication with her was excellent from the first second to the end! High availability, warm, caring and motherly attitude, with a real sense of goodwill and concern for the guests. Sandra was always welcoming, attentive and willing to help, even with the little things. For example, when I was looking for a convenient way to Central Park and the route Google suggested was cumbersome and long, she gave me simple and wise advice that saved time and unnecessary detours, all out of genuine concern. The cleanliness was very high - the room is clean, tidy and pleasant, the kitchen is clean and well-equipped, and it was always clear that it was important to her that everything be well-maintained and that nothing be missing. The neighborhood itself is very inviting and central in Brooklyn. The train station is very close, about a 4-minute walk, trains pass frequently, and accessibility is excellent. There's a supermarket nearby and everything you need within walking distance. I highly recommend staying with Sandra!!! A place that feels safe, pleasant, clean and managed with heart and with a lot of thought and soul in every detail. This is definitely my place for next time. Thanks for everything, Sandra. Thanks to you, the visit to New York has become a great experience. Translated from Hebrew Show original",5
"I had a great stay at Sandra’s place. It was really close to the metro stop, grocery store and a pharmacy. The building has original wooden floors and staircase which adds a lot of charm to it.",5
"Sandra is friendly and accommodating. She was happy to arrange an early-morning check-in for me, which was very important to me as I take an overnight flight from my country. I could tell that security and the well-being of her guests is very important to her. The house is located in Prospect Park South, which is a great neighborhood. It's very safe and you're literally a two-minute walk from the Cortelyou Subway Station on the ""Q"" line with easy access to Manhattan. There's a Key Foods, the Food Co-op, numerous delis and a couple of pharmacies, all within easy reach.",5
"It was my first solo traveling experience and I got to say it was a blessing staying at Sandra's. It truly felt like home. There where other guests but I didn't see them much, so it was pretty quiet. Sandra and her family live in the 1st and 2nd floor, so you I didn't get to see them either, but they were there for anything I needed. Sandra, you are so nice and easy to talk too. You made me feel better when I was going through a rough time, and staying at your place made my trip truly unforgettable. Thank you for your kindness and for making me feel like home.",5
"11 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · June 2024 I had a fantastic stay at Sandra’s place! The cleanliness was impeccable—both the bedroom and bathroom were spotless. The kitchen was well-equipped, making it easy to prepare meals. The location is unbeatable. It’s just a 2-minute walk to the Q line and about 8 minutes to the B line. Getting to Manhattan is a breeze from Sandra’s place. Plus, the neighborhood feels safe even at night. For groceries, there are several convenient options within a 2-minute walk. I highly recommend Sandra’s place and will definitely stay here again next time I’m in New York.",5
"Sandra is definitely an excellent host, the place is quite and safe, and you find around different options such as supermarkets, restaurants, etc. Is an excellent option!",5
Sandra was an awesome host. Her airbnb feels homey and peaceful. Particularly liked how accessible it is to the subway (less than 3 minutes walk) and grocery store/restaurants.,5
"Fantastic place in Brooklyn! Looks exactly like photos, feels like home :) Sandra & her family were extremely nice and helpful. Location has direct connection with Manhattan main spots. 100% recommended!",5
Sandra was a great host. Very responsive and helpful. House is squeaky clean and beautiful. Room is small but perfect for what I needed. Train station is literally steps away. Bathroom is spotless which I loved. Will definitely be back.,5
"Thanks to Sandra and her listing, I was able to fulfill my dream of living in New York for two weeks, but without spending a fortune on a hotel in Manhattan. Sandra is a very helpful and very kind person, she always responded quickly to my doubts and although I do not speak English very well, we always had the opportunity to talk and discuss. The house is about 300 meters from the Q line and about 800 meters from the B line, with which you can reach Manhattan in 20 minutes and Times Square in 30 minutes. And then traveling by subway under the Manhattan Bridge from which to admire the beauty of the city is priceless! The house literally has everything, spare bedding, towels, iron, hair dryer, ceiling fan and a nice large fridge. The neighborhood is very quiet, although every now and then I've noticed some strange people, but I know it's part of the city. The times I've checked in late, I've always felt calm and safe.

My stay went well overall, but I encountered some difficulties such as street noise and music late at night, I had to wear earplugs. Sandra has nothing to do with it.

I have only good comments about the place and Sandra ! The room is cute. I really loved the neighborhood (the Madeline coffee place is great to grab a coffee or a breakfast!). The subway is just around the corner. The home is wellcoming with a cute flowery garden. Sandra is very friendly but also gives a lot of space. It’s quiet. The bed is great - I slept very well !). The common spaces are clean and practical. So go for it !,5
"Staying at Sandra's house is a privilege. Very clean, thanks to Ivonne's dedication, with an atmosphere of friendship and collaboration. With the subway so close, getting to Manhattan is easy: in 30 minutes I was inTime Square. I don't even think about changing address. Sandra's house will always be my favorite place to stay in NY.",5

Beautiful stay with Sandra and family.,5
"Sandra's place is a gem! Good vibe, extremely clean, cozy, and a fantastic neighborhood had a lot of options and conveniences. I was there for business for 2 weeks, I am a New Yorker who has relocated out of state, so it was fun to be in a part of the city that was unfamiliar to me. Would recommend for business or pleasure. Quick express train to Manhattan. I was at my office in Flatiron in about 30 min each morning. Sandra is a lovely person with a beautiful home. Excellent stay.",5
"Really enjoyed my stay! Sandra and family were lovely to talk to, location is great for getting into Manhattan and Brooklyn, room was exactly what I needed and great value! Would stay again.",5
"Couldn't recommend this Airbnb more. Incredibly convenient for the subway - literally 2 minutes around the corner from Cortelyou Road, so very easy to pop up to Manhattan or down to Coney Island. Felt very safe - some beautiful houses in the nearby areas. Great selection of shops and restaurants just minutes away from the property. The house itself is absolutely beautiful - very tastefully decorated. My room was the smallest of the available, but there was lots of storage so it never felt cramped. Sandra is delightful, and never felt in any way intrusive. Full marks, would love to come back.",5
It was an excellent 4 days of stay at Sandra's place. Loved her hospitality and responsiveness. It is also very close to the metro which makes travel throughout NYC very easy and convenient. Would definitely recommend this place if you are looking to stay in Brooklyn.,5
Sandra and Cary were so friendly and welcoming. I stayed at their airbnb for a month and everything went perfectly well. The only bummer was that the room didn't have an AC so it got hot but I totally recommend!,5

It was really nice to find the calm of this house after a day in New York City. Sandra is very nice. The house is very clean and comfortable. There is good access to public transport (bus and metro). Translated from French Show original,5
"My stay couldn't have wished for more. The house is very clean and cozy. The neighborhood is great, two minutes walk to the subway! Sandra was an excellent host, I could leave my children staying there. A big hug, I hope to be back soon! Translated from Portuguese Show original",5
"I stayed in Sandra`s and Cary`s house for two months and I can really recommend the accommodation. I really enjoyed my stay in her house. Sandra and Cary were extremely friendly and welcoming. The room was clean and amazing, just like in the pictures. The area is centrally located and also safe. You can get to Manhattan within 25 minutes. The subway station is close to the house. Great place to stay forever and I really enjoyed my stay in her house. I love the garden with their beautiful plants. In this accommodation you have everything what you need. I would stay 100% again. I wish you all the best and thank you!!!",5
Very kind and helpful. Definitely recommend to stay here for an affordable and quality experience.,5
It was the perfect room/neighborhood/host for me! Sandra and Carey were very friendly and gave me the impression I could always come to them with any questions. They welcomed me with open hearts but did never intrude my privacy. Most of the time I had the whole upper floor (3rd) to myself and could use the kitchen and bathroom whenever I wanted. The room was clean and the neighbourhood very calm. I slept like a baby in this comfortable bed. Also the flat is located right next to a subway station with a direct line to manhattan. It takes around 40-45min. to go to manhattan by subway. The neighbourhood also felt safe and there were a lot of stores and food opportunities in the area. So all in all a perfect experience! Thank you so much Sandra and Carey <3,5
"A proper host, very welcoming, safe neighborhood, adequate facilities and snacks provided with a kitchen at ones disposal. Very nice house",5
"I booked this place largely off of positive reviews and unfortunately did not have the positive experience others have raved about. The place is clean and properly listed, but my experience with the host made this stay very unpleasant. Notably, there was an incident where I had gone to sit in the unoccupied room next to my bedroom. The door was open and I had not realized it was considered off limits. Sandra was very upset with me despite my immediate apology and I felt scolded over an honest mistake. It was a wildly unpleasant exchange that felt very disproportionate. Additionally worth noting, there are a lot of security cameras in the house and in the area where you stay. Comfort with being recorded will vary guest to guest, I did not really like them. Overall I would say this is not much of a “home away from home,” it’s being a guest in someone’s home, which is fine but not the experience I thought I was paying for.",3
"Sandra's place is wonderful. And Sandra is very polite and helpful. Very close to the subway station. When I return to New York, I'll stay there. Translated from Portuguese Show original",5
"Amazing hosts, amazing house, amazing all around experience! Highly recommend!",5
"My stay at Sandra and Cary's accommodation was amazing! Sandra was a wonderful host answering my questions and providing recommendations. The place was clean, quiet, and comfortable. The Q train was a very short walk away with easy access into Manhattan. I highly recommend and would definitely stay there again. Thank you Sandra and Cary!",5
"Sandra’s place was perfect for my stay. She is such a lovely host and I highly recommend her well cared for townhouse. The place was very clean and the kitchen has nice touches… tea, coffee, snacks & basic cooking amenities. The neighborhood is great, wine bars, tapas, bodegas and coffee shop, and so close to the subway. Definitely one of the best Airbnb experiences in NYC, thanks for hosting me!",5
It was a very clean and nice room. The kitchen is spacious but you only have two burners so make them count. The location is nice and the subway station is right next door and the surrounding community was very pleasant too. Everything was just like advertised. Sandra and cary are lovely hosts and i would gladly stay again.,5
"Sandra is a charming woman, intelligent, communicative, willing to help. The bedroom is exactly what you see in the photos, with the advantage of having a huge closet that facilitates organization in the small space. The Q train station is 2 minutes away and Cortelyou (station street) has a supermarket, restaurants, pharmacies, all very convenient. I loved the stay and I intend to return.",5
"Stay for 3 weeks, the room is private, quite a d clean. The bed is comfortable, I always enjoy great sleep at night. The location is wonderful which is only two minutes walk for the Q train, running every day. The hosts are really helpful and keep everything really clean. They also prepare breakfast for guests and give us as much help as possible. I enjoyed a really pleasant trip and stay. Thank you. Will come back next time.",5
"I loved my stay at Sandra's house. The location couldn't be better, super close to the subway station, laundromat, restaurants, and markets. Everybody in the house was so kind to me and concerned about providing me the best time possible. I will definitely travel back to NYC and this is going to be the first place I will look for a place to stay.",5
"The place is very close to the subway and the neighbourhood is peaceful. Clean bathroom, helpful hosts. There are a few house rules which are quite fair. If you have limited time in New York, you need to allot at least 40 minutes travelling by train to Manhattan. However, the location is reasonable if you're not in a rush.",4
"I had an absolutely amazing time here, the hosts were incredibly friendly and nice and the location of the house made it very to explore Brooklyn as well as getting into Manhattan The house itself is very pretty and is steeped in history. I will be definitely recommending to my friends and family about booking here as well as rebooking here next time I’m in the area.",5
"Great stay. Loved the couple conversations I got to have with Sandra. She was very hospitable--giving me the scoop right when I got in, providing plenty of towels, and letting me feel at home in the upstairs kitchen. The house had a couple other people staying in it, which made it feel active and lively, but was still quiet from my room. In a great neighborhood too. Hope to return next time I spend a night in NY.",5
"Cortelyou road is 25min from Manhattan, it has supermarkets and places to eat. The neighborhood is quiet and the people are nice. The room is clean as all the house is, and the other persons renting rooms on the same floor were very respectful and friendly. Sandra and her family are lovely and reliable people .",5
"I have spent a great time in Sandra and Cary's home. The location is very near from the subway, so you can arrive to every part at New York. The neighborhood is quiet , I had no problems when I arrived late at night (I was alone). The bedroom is exactly the bedroom in the photo. The place is very clean. Sandra provides us the breakfast and the most important she is a very nice person. So, I highly recommend her place.",5
"I extended my stay with Sandra and Cary, the entire experience was relaxing and afforded me a peace of mind to handle my affairs. The picture that's shown is exactly as advertised, everything about the accommodations are accurate. Clean, peaceful, efficient with access to several mass transit outlets as well as parking. Highly recommended for professionals and vacationers alike.",5
"Sandra and Cary are amazing hosts, charming and welcoming, I felt at ease during my stay. The accommodation matched the pic exactly! The neighborhood is very quiet at the same time offering easy access to mass transit and a variety of shops. The home is beautifully decorated, clean and comfortable. I would recommend this place to anyone visiting NYC",5
I really liked staying at Sandra and Cary's place! It was very easy to get to by subway and there were a lot of amenities around. Sandra and Cary were also very friendly and helped me whenever I needed it. The place was as described.,5
"I had a really great time in Sandra's accommodation, it's complete of everything, spacious and very clean, in a very convenient position just one minute by walk from the Q metro stop, in a very quiet neighborhood, with all the services and shops you need (supermarket, laundry .. ) a few meters. Sandra is a beautiful person, nice, very kind, hospitable and pleasant to chat with, available for every need... you'll meet a very precious woman. I definitely recommend this apartment to everyone, perfect experience!",5
"I'm absolutely sure I couldn't have had best hosts! Sandra went out of her way a handful of times to be accommodating, which I truly appreciate! Her place is very clean and well kept. Her garden is lovely and the room is very comfortable (also, there's lots of storage room). The kitchen is very well-equipped and overall, the location is superb! Very, I mean VERY close to the underground, and you'll find anything you need nearby. I loved my stay and I would highly recommend this place!",5
"I had a wonderful stay with Sandra and would definitely book again if given the opportunity. Her place is so convenient, just around the corner from the subway and right off one of the main corridors in Flatbush. The home itself is beautiful and full of character. Such a great value!",5
The space is a bit smaller in person but it was more than enough for 2 people. The bathroom was excellent and anything you could need is provided for you. Overall a really solid stay and we would do again! The only thing I will note is that the living space isnt completely private. You can hear the people next to you very clearly and the only thing separating you is a door. Cars are also pretty loud at night but that's not in the hosts control.,4
"The location was great a nice area, host was so very friendly and extremely helpful and responsive when needed. The place was great value for money exactly what we needed for our stay. Would stay again and would recommend.",5
"I 100% recommend this property! I visited Tahimi’s property with my husband, and it was exactly as described in the listing. The bed was comfortable, the bathroom spacious, and everything was very clean. Tahimi’s responsiveness is unmatched—she replies quickly and is very kind. In addition, we found lovely details like coffee capsules, bottled water, and some personal care items that came in handy. Thank you for being a great host! 🤍",5
"Great space, just like the pictures. Everything was very clean, Tahimi was very accommodating and the place was very well stocked. We were able to walk around at different times of the day and always felt safe. The place is a 5 min walk to a bus stop which was very convenient. Would definitely stay again.",5
"We would definitely return to this air BnB, it was spotless and so comfortable with additional little extras like spare tooth brush to make our stay more enjoyable. Area felt safe and it was so straight forward to find/access. Thank you for having us! :)",5
"My fiancé and I really enjoyed our stay! The place looked exactly like the pictures, was very clean, and cozy. The host was very responsive anytime we needed anything. We had some trouble with the lock the first time getting in, messages the host and she fixed it right away! Definitely recommend!",5
"We had a great stay at Tahimi’s place! The apartment was very clean, and the bed was comfortable and spotless. It had everything we needed for a short stay, including toiletries, which was a nice touch. The neighborhood was quiet and felt very safe. It takes around 45 minutes to reach the city center by bus, but considering the price and overall comfort, it’s an excellent deal. Check-in was smooth and easy. Perfect spot for couples looking for a cozy and affordable stay!",5
"Super cute place! We spent pretty much all of our time in the city so we didn’t really hang out, but it was the perfect size for us to just have a clean and safe place to crash after spending the day in the city. Just a couple blocks away from the bus stop! Would definitely stay again.",5
"This was a cute little studio for the short time that I stayed. Looked just like the photos, and the host was always responsive and helpful if I needed anything.",5
Tahimi’s place was beautiful and quaint. Super close to the bus stop to get to NYC just as described. It was just as described with many amenities. Tahimi is a very kind and accommodating host as she was very responsive and receptive to our flight arrival and departure. Definitely recommend if you want to explore both NJ and NYC!,5
"My girlfriend and I had a great time staying in the studio over the weekend. It was quiet, felt private, and was a short drive away from everything we were looking for. The space was extremely clean and even came with snacks. Tahimi was always responsive in a timely manner and was very helpful with parking and other instructions. We would stay here again any time.",5
My stay at Tahimi’s place met my expectations as she was a very communicative host and handled small issues proactively. The place was great for 2 guests and came with many amenities inside the room which I greatly appreciated. Overall I would highly recommend this place for solo travellers and couples. Great location. I would definitely stay here again. Thank you!,5
The Airbnb was really perfect. It had everything I needed. It was very clean and everything in the apartment looked new. Absolutely great for a single traveler or a couple. The apartment is very close to various bus stops where you can find direct busses to Times Square. I can really recommend other travelers to stay at this place!,5
"Our stay at this place was amazing! Despite being a bit tiny, it’s very warm and and cozy for traveling couples!, and it’s a walking distance to NYC bus and lots and lots of restaurants and stores. Tahimi’s been absolutely fantastic, very responsive and accommodating. She definitely made our stay easier and more enjoyable. Keep the good work.",5
"Very nice place, and very nice host, highly recommended..thank you for everything. Will come back again in the future ♥️",5
Nice clean little space close to the city and very reasonably priced,5
Great place and price! This is my first time at an airbnb and I am happy to say I left with a really good impression.,5
"Great place, private and comfortable, near to a bus stop. Great places to eat near by. There is caffe machine and a lot of welcome details that made us feel great.",5
"I can not rave enough about how great Tahimi place was. This was my first time staying in an Airbnb and it exceeded all my expectations. This was definitely worth paying for rather than staying at an overpriced hotel in Times Square. The bus is only a 6 minute walk and it takes you straight to Times Square. The neighborhood is very family oriented and friendly I even became friends with one the neighbors. I’m a really big clean freak so it’s always hard for me to feel comfortable in a space that isn’t mine but you can tell Tahimi takes pride in her space. It honestly felt like I had our own studio apartment. Everything was clean, organized, modern and updated. Tahimi honestly out did a lot of the hotels I have stayed at! She had every amenity ready from umbrellas, to shower caps, to coffee/ tea, lotion, body wash, toothbrush/ toothpaste, etc you name it and she had it. Even the bed was extremely comfortable I felt right at home! I will definitely be staying here again.",5
"tahimi and the unit is really great! Everything very clean, well set up, thoughtfully put together. Bed sheets and pillow were so so comfy, bed itself was nice too. Really great bathroom with special heating in there included. Who doesn't love some good heat agter a shower. Smaller than I though, but I didn't care I new it was small to begin with and quality is more important anyhow. Tahimi was responsive, kind, and helpful throughout. Thank you, Tahimi!",5
"I had an amazing stay with Tahimi. We had a private studio that was so clean, had all the right amenities including shampoo conditioner and body wash, and we were even provided snacks and drinks. The host was always immediately responsive whenever we had questions. I would highly recommend.",5
"Tahimi’s apartment was perfect! Beautifully remodeled/converted. The bed was comfortable. Everything was in working order and clean. I was able to meet Tahimi in person - she is lovely! Parking is a bear, but the location is super convenient to NYC.",5
Very beautiful spot to spend your days when visiting the area. In close proximity to alot of restaurants and stores. Very close to NYC bus ! The host was very accommodating and friendly.,5
Great host. Very responsive and respectful. At no point did I feel uneasy about anything. Would recommend to anybody looking for a place to stay for a vacation. Well done.,5
"The room was spotless, and communication was excellent, it honestly felt just like a hotel room. I really loved everything about my stay. The only minor issue was that the window A/C unit left small gaps on the sides, so some cold air came in, especially when it was chilly outside. But that wasn’t a big deal at all. Overall, it’s in a great location, the neighborhood feels very safe, and I’d definitely recommend staying here.",5
"Absolutely great place to stay. Exactly as listing stated, Matt was friendly and responsive. Just outside the city with plenty of ways to get to New York nearby. 10/10 experience.",5
"Everything was clean and as described and for the price the location was amazing. Its very easy to get to New York and back by bus. It was a very enjoyable stay, would recommend.",5
"Matt is a very responsive host! The place is nice and clean, looks like the photos. The area is very nice and close to a walking trail. The only problem I had with this place is the parking! It took 40-50 min of driving around to finally find parking.",5
Completely satisfied everything was perfect and clean and I never felt unattended by the hosts and also there was a lot of privacy which was what all I needed completely worth my money,5
Nice amenities and good place for easy access to NYC. Highly recommended.,5
Great spot if you just need a place to lay your head at night.,5
Nice place host was very clear with all instructions and very good location to go back and forth from nyc by public transit,5
"4 months on Airbnb Rating, 1 star , · January 2026 The bathroom light came on and didn't come on. The microwave and water purifier didn't work well either. The water pressure in the bathroom was too weak to even wash. The room smelled like marijuana. Worst place to stay. Translated from Korean Show original",1
Good place,5
Perfect place to stay and visit NYC.,5
Amazing stay & good connectivity to the city,5
Very great location. Room was very nice and a great neighborhood.,5
"Everything perfect! They give for free Coffee , water and tea. If í come back to NY i will reserve here again",5
Very nice people clean and neat you should stay with them 🙏,5
"7 months on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · July 2025 Great place to stay! Amenities were greatly appreciated!",5
A cost place to stay with easy public transit to NYC. The shuttle to New York is a few minutes walk from the place. I like the surrounding area with NYC view. It’s much better stay in crowded NYC. The hosts communicate well and they helped to storage my baggages after check out. That very kind and hard to find host like this for Airbnb. Thank you so much we had a really great time staying at your place.,5
"It was amazing to stay here, it is very close to station of transit bus to New York. And bus takes about 20 min to the city. Very clean and quiet place. Host was very friendly and quick to answer to everything. Neighborhood was also quiet, clean , you have great view of nyc, markets and restaurants. Will definitely stay here when coming back.",5
"Good location, great room, but if you have a noisy roommate, you can definitely hear them because of the thin walls. The shower room is decent. 8.5 out of 10. This was my first time trying a shared room and the overall experience was great nothing to complain about due to the good price and the very responsive host.",5
"He was very friendly and concerned about me. I recommend their accommodation for the cleanliness of the rooms, safe area and good services for guests. Translated from Spanish Show original",5
"Absolutely sufficient, clean, quiet place. Close to beautiful views of Manhattan. The owner is caring and responds very quickly. Translated from Czech Show original",5
"Very comfortable room, comfortable bed with quality sheets and towels, we really appreciated the presence of a small refreshment corner with water, coffee pods and tea, in addition to the presence of a microwave oven that on some occasions was very useful for heating ready meals after returning tired from long days in NY. Small shops and bakeries and restaurants in the street just above the house were really convenient, while the bus stop is in the street just below, facing a breathtaking view of the NY skyline. We thank Matt because he has always been very kind and quick to help us with any small unforeseen event or need. Translated from Italian Show original",5
great stay as usual- it has been my fourth time I think,5
"This was the perfect spot for exploring the city. Close to public transport and great dining options, yet quiet enough to unwind after a busy day. The host was super responsive and made everything easy.",5
"The room is good and cozy, ac was perfect and warm. It is on the 4th floor so a little tricky if you have big luggage. By the way it is a dorm situation but personal room is private with lock. Main concern was the bathroom, there’s mold in the shower and walls, but other than that it is a good quick stay.",4
"The looks as the pictures, except those may be old pictures as there is noticeable dust, and webs in the bedroom, and worn out bedspread. The bath/shower is not properly cleaned as there is black mold on shower door and on ceiling plus very dusty vent. The cleaning fee is not being used to clean and maintain the place. It is in the 4th floor as described, you do share the apartment with others including the restroom. It is good enough to sleep and leave the next day.",3
Had wonderful stay in this cute apartment. Incredibly well situated - minutes from the Q line station. Very clean and has everything you need. Be mindful it’s on 4th Floor with no elevator so would be difficult with large luggage. Huimin was incredibly helpful and friendly. Would definitely recommend!,5
"The area is great, The room is confortable, has closet nice closet. kitchen has basic things you need, bathroom is decent. It feels very private, even though you share the apartment. The only thing is that the check in instructions did not match the address listed in the Airbnb page but two blocks away from the listed address. It did not affect my plans, but it created some initial confusion. Other than that, I had a great time at Celine's place!",5
"The location of the house is very convenient. You can walk 20+min to the Metropolitan Museum. It takes 5 minutes to walk to a relatively large supermarket. It is only a 3-minute walk from the 86th subway station of Line Q. But this is the stairs on the fourth floor. If you have large luggage, it is not recommended to stay here. There was no air conditioner when we first checked in. Huimin responded to us quickly and solved the problem the next day.",5
"This place has a great location and affordable price. Its 2 blocks from the Q Line entrance. Even if you don't feel comfortable with the subway, there is a decent amount of GOOD restaurants and bars that are within walking distance. Although it was affordable, there were certain amenities that you still expect to be in functioning order that need maintenance. The majority of outlets in our room did not work, the smell of someone smoking from one of the other apartments would drift into the room daily, and the door knob to front door can easily detach if you turn it in the wrong direction, locking you in. The 2x2 notecard with tiny print is the only warning that this occurs. Even after it was fixed, it still would not open the door reliably, making coming and going an anxious experience of whether you will be locked in for the day. On the plus side, there was a Heater/AC unit in the window, which helped control the constant fluctuation of temperature.",3
"The apartment was very well located. There are subway stations near the flat and we were in the city quite fast. Celine was helpful and replied quickly. Our only concearn is that the apartment wasn‘t that clean, especially the walls. Overall it was a nice stay and if you are looking for a affordable appartment this one is a good choice.",4
"It was a great stay! The place is well located, there are restaurants, bars, supermarkets and the Central Park is 10 minutes walking, also some museums. There is a subway 2m away. The bed is comfortable and the air conditioner was working properly in a hot day. We think that should be great have one also in the dining area. They are super responsive, thank you so much for the stay!",5
Great spot if you're looking for a cheaper spot to stay on the Upper East Side. Located near lots of restaurants and shops. Overall tight space but very clean. Decor/bedding could use some updates. AC worked but still a bit warm. Would consider staying again if hotels are too expensive for a 1-2 night stay!,4
"The actual address was different from what I originally booked, but only a block away so that wasn't a huge deal. The A/C didn't cool the room and I had missed the detail that the unit was a 4th floor walk-up, so that was unexpected. The listing said room with a patio, but I never saw a patio (unless it was the rooftop, to which I never went).",3
"clear instructions from host, great location & access to restaurants/central park/subway. heat is not controlled by unit and was therefore exceptionally overpowered. even with window wide open (in the low 40s at night) + a fan, it was very hot in the room and uncomfortable to sleep. because of that, I probably wouldn't stay again but everything else was great.",3
"Everything is on the listing including no elevator (fun exercise going up and down 4 floors) and noisy street. This is very transparent. Great place and amazing location. Comfortable bed. The only issue is the heat which made the room very hot. However, for the amazing price, its hard to complain. Celine was very friendly and very responsive.",5
Great place! Easy walk to the subway plenty of restaurants beautiful area! Would stay here again,5
"Good place to stay at for a few days. It's close to a station to get to the other areas of Manhatten/New York. The apartment is divided into 3 areas (2 rooms + one person living in the hallway) which was a little weird at first because you always walk past another person to get to your room. The AC in our room worked perfectly and the bed was really comfy. Unfortunately there was webbing all over the upper parts of the walls, which could have received an extra wipe beforehand. Otherwise nice and convenient.",4
"Overall it was a good stay. Location was nice and was close to the subway. Pay attention to the address she gives you in the message - that's the right one. I walked to the one that was originally provided at first, which was only a block away, but it was really hot outside so it was sad to have to turn around. Also the key/lock combos are a little different than described, and the front door of the building is finicky, so getting in was a bit of struggle until I could figure it out. For me, the AC was perfect and kept the room chilled",4
"Great location on the UES close to subway station. Was visiting NY for a few days and this was a good place to rest after a long day as it was pretty quiet. AC worked but was just a bit loud. Celine was very responsive and I had a smooth, painless stay!",5
"A+ host, clear and quick responses. lovely location with quick subway access and many shops and restaurants near by. would hope to go again sometime. thank you for having us 🙏",5
The host was very attentive. I had an issue with the temperature of the room and the heater which only the building manager was able to turn off. She took my issue seriously and communicated with the building manager until it was resolved. I really appreciated this.,5
"This is my second time to stay in the Manhattan room and it's so great! The location is amazing, so close to the subway, GREAT food on the same block and I feel safe walking at night!! As a female traveler that loves to do solo trips this is an amazing location!!!",5
"Wonderful apartment in a safe area, Hosts were extremely helpful in checking in and out",5
"I was contacted politely about how to check in. The room is on the 4th floor and you have to climb the stairs, so it can be a bit difficult if you have large luggage. I went in late November, but the room was always warm and comfortable. Translated from Japanese Show original",4
This is a bedroom with shared small bathroom within an apartment.,3
"[ENG below] The apartment is in a very good location, and the city center is very easily accessible without taking transport. The apartment was clean, and the host was responsive when we had a problem with the front door (the handle is misleading and we found ourselves locked inside). Check-in and checkout were quick and smooth. We were even able to leave our suitcases for a late check-out while waiting for our flight, leaving us the day free. Thanks again! The apartment was very well located, and the city center easily reachable on foot. The apartment was tidy, and the host was responsive when we had a problem with the door (the knob was a bit tricky and we were locked inside). The check-in and checkout were easy, and we were able to leave our luggage for a late checkout until we had to go to the airport, giving us a last day luggage-free. Thanks again!

"A wonderful place to stay! Exactly what was described, and the host was very responsive. Would definitely book again!",5
"1 year on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · 4 weeks ago I had a really nice stay at Jay’s place. Everything was wonderful, and his roommate was really kind. If anyone seeing this is looking for a place to stay near Columbia university, I absolutely recommend this place. 100% worth it.",5
Jay is a great host and his place is at a perfect location for our purpose of visit. There are so many grocery stores and restaurants all within short walking distance. He responded quickly to all our requests and questions. The place has a very well stocked and organized kitchen and we felt secure and safe staying in that building. His staff was friendly and kind. This was our second time staying at Jay’s place and we booked his place again already for our next trip in June. Thank you.,5
"I stayed for five days in Jay's apartment and I really enjoyed it. The communication was very easy and helpful. You have to know that you share the flat with two other people, everyone in their own room. Jay's roommate Margarita was very helpful with everything. The kitchen is fully equipped, the bathroom is very clean, the location is perfect, especially if you have things to do at Columbia University, or generally if you want to see more of New York than just Times Square. I had a very positive experience and I would come again.",5
"Really nice, quiet, and safe location. Only a 4 minute walk to the subway. Room and bathroom is clean and all you need is there. Will definitely book again when I go back to New York.",5
"Apartment is located in a very lively, convenient location and loved the safety of the area. Very accurate description to the room. Could fit two but I used the bathroom to get ready most of time for the space. It’s close to central park and so many restaurants and very walkable area! I would return. Only thing was inconvenient was small - the sheets/pillow cases for the bed wasn’t made, it was folded to be put on the bed and after a day of traveling I would have preferred the bed been ready to sleep in.",4
"Jay is a great and super responsive host! The apartment is in a great location, super close to restaurants and the subway! Would definitely stay again",5
"modest place but extremely worth the price, very convenient place if you want to go around Manhattan.",5
He was very kind and helpful. The location was convenient for going everywhere and it was very quiet. I really enjoyed my stay.,5
Location is very accessible to the subway. Great value for money and host Jay is very accommodating!,5
"Jay's place is very well located with great markets, restaurants and pharmacies nearby. The space is very clean and comfortable with a comfortable bed, closet space, a small fan, a desk and small table plus a well-stocked bathroom. Jay was especially helpful when I wanted to drop my luggage off before the check-in time and was immediately responsive when I asked questions. I've used Airbnb all over the US, in Canada, New Zealand, Brazil and Europe over the past years and Jay's place is among the best for value and cleanliness. I hope to stay at his place again.",5
"Jay’s place was perfect for a short stay with my boyfriend. Everything was as described in the house manual. Very close (< 5 min walk) to the subway, restaurants, and grocery stores (Hmart, CVS, Duane Reade). Perfect location & very clean space.",5
"I really enjoyed my stay in this unit… exactly as advertised with direct subway options, essential amenities, clean, spacious, easy check-in.. all from a friendly host. Hope it’s available again when I return to NYC. Thank you Jay!",5
"Jay was very helpful and responsive. The place is very clean and a block away from the train which was very helpful to move around easily, also many shops and restaurants in the area and that is a big plus for this location.",5
"Great safe area, and place was very clean. Had a great stay.",4
"Jay and Margarita are very attentive and helpful! They allowed early check-in and late check-out due to my flight schedule and not having any other guests scheduled. The apartment is simple but very clean and organized. It's a 4-minute walk from the nearest subway station, which is great for those who are visiting and want to take the subway everywhere in NYC. I recommend it mainly for the attention and helpfulness, in addition to the location! Translated from Portuguese Show original",5
Room was perfect for a short visit,4
"The room was as advertised and very comfortable. Great bed, super shower, wonderful neighborhood.",5
"3 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · May 2025 Had a great time staying here. Safe - the neighbourhood is full of students. Jay was very helpful. The bakery around the corner is to die for! 100% recommend",5
"Jay was very accommodating when it came to our late check in. I did not get a chance to meet him, but he was very responsive. Free street parking was a bonus.",5
"I was very happy with the communication with Jay. The apartment was clean and cozy. Safe area, good access to public transport. I'd love to come back. Translated from German Show original",5
"Everything was as described. Jay is very friendly and responds quickly. The accommodation was great, I felt totally comfortable. The surroundings are also great. The subway is right around the corner and you can get everywhere by train. On my next vacation to New York, I will book this place again :-) Translated from German Show original",5
"Overall a good stay. Our room was clean and tidy, the bed was comfortable. It was a very convenient location as well as a safe area. Everything we needed was within walking distance, but it is also a very busy area so you can hear a lot of traffic and conversations from the window. Only negatives was having to share one bathroom between 2 other couples, and also one towel between two of us. Jay was a friendly host.",4
"Happy with our stay! Communication was great, flexible and easy. The place matches the description very well; you share bathroom and kitchen with other guests in a normal, residential building. The area is safe and calm. New York is in general expensive and taking that into account, the price matches what you get.",5
"Very walkable to public transpo - great views just a few minutes walk too! Even though the bathroom was shared, it still felt very private and peaceful. I had a lot of questions when I checked in and Luz was able to answer all of them with easy recommendations! 10/10 stay would definitely stay here again if I need to come back to NJ/NYC!",5
"The place was clean and comfortable, and Luz was super nice, respectful, and welcoming. The room was as advertised so I had no problems at all. The location had a beautiful view of the city, almost magical. I will definitely book again with her.",5
"I had a great stay here during my NYC trip. The room was clean, quiet, and exactly as described, making it a comfortable place to relax after long days of exploring the city. The check-in process was smooth, and the instructions provided were clear and easy to follow. The North Bergen location worked well as a home base, with convenient access to Manhattan via public transit. I also appreciated how peaceful the neighborhood was, which made it easy to rest and recharge. Overall, this was a pleasant and comfortable stay, and I’m grateful for the hospitality.",5
"I had a good experience at this Airbnb! The place was top notch in terms of quality, and the host was incredibly friendly and welcoming, always responsive and helpful. Everything was straightforward and easy to understand, which made my stay stress free. It's perfect for solo travelers, and the convenience of being so close to New York City is a huge plus just a quick trip down including the bus stop not even being a 2 minute walk from the stay. I thoroughly enjoyed my time there and would definitely book again. Highly recommended (:",5
"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Rating, 4 stars , · October 2025 Very convenient to NYC. The room and bathroom were very clean. I rented this room since ‘dedicated bathroom’ was noted on the listing but then it was also described as ‘shared bathroom’ in the details paragraph which I did not read carefully. Like another reviewer said, I was under the impression this was one of two bedrooms in a house, and not one of several. That said, when I was there it was quiet and without lots of other renters and I did not have trouble accessing the bathroom when I needed it.",4
"The room was clean, and good if you are just there to sleep and not spend much time. I didn't realize it would be a boarding house before staying. It was a little inconvenient sharing a bathroom with 5-6 other people. The bathroom also had some noticeable mold near the ceiling from a previous water leak which I am highly allergic to, but did not complain as it wouldn't have been fixed in the short time I stayed there. Pack light if staying here because the stairs to get up to your room are made for tiny people with no luggage. Overall it was fine and an alright stay for the price.",4
"Very easy to get in and out of NYC via bus. Luz is very friendly and replies fast. The apartment is very clean and you enter via code locks. There are two shared bathrooms for around 8 rooms, but they were almost never occupied when I wanted to use them.",5
30min with the bus to Times Square. I like the location and the price. l also like that you could come and go whenever you wanted.,5
Lovely stay at Luz’s place - very well connected with a 25 minute bus into NYC a minute’s walk away. Would definitely stay again!,5
"Great place, only 30 mins away from Times Square by bus. Luz is an amazing host who always responded to my messages in no time at all. Definitely recommended!",5
I spent 10 days in NYC and the room was perfect ! I will definitely recommend this place to someone alone who would visit NYC ! Everything was perfect and clean ! Instructions were clear and Luz was so ractive ! I would recommend!!,5
This was a wonderful stay! The room was delightful and location was very convenient to catch buses to NYC. I also appreciated how communicative Luz was and how clear all their instructions were. Will definitely be back if I'm in the area!,5
"Luz and family were very welcoming, kind and exceptional hosts! The unit is well maintained and clean. The house is located in a peaceful location of NJ across the street from the park, river and buses that leads you straight into NYC. We highly recommend and would book again. For anyone with a physical disability or finds tight spaces and stairs challenging, note that the home is a typical Victorian architecture. There's 2 thin, winding triangle staircases leading to the bedroom.",5
"Nice host very friendly and quick respond ,location with amazing close to NYC and skyline view was beautiful I will book it again and will recommend it to my friends while visiting new jersey.",5
"A great stay. Perfect for the folks on solo trips. Easy to find & a nice walking distance from park, coffee shops & bus stops. Easy commute in and out of the city. Need somewhere to just rest your head, this is perfect.",5
Great location - right off the bus route.,5
"- Excellent host communication - Responded to all of my questions prior to arriving - Good location - Easy to find - Neighborhood is pleasant - Very short walk to bus stop and city skyline view - Great stay - Clean, spacious room - External noise was minimal - Felt safe leaving my belongings - Bathroom is shared but very clean and good shower - Option to do laundry is convenient If you're visiting NYC, the NJ Transit bus gets you to Port Authority Bus Terminal in about 20 minutes, where you can connect to the MTA. It’s easier than it sounds and works out well. Overall, I’d gladly stay here again. Thank you!",5
easy to find and Luz response so quickly when I contact,5
"Luz was a very nice and helpful host, she was proactive to speak for help and recommendations. The location was perfect to get to Manhattan. The bus stop is 3 minutes' walk from home, which is why the way was also pleasant. My room was as described in the ad and clean. I had a very nice stay at Luz's place. Translated from German Show original",5
"Wonderful room, spacious and comfortable.",5
Thank you for the easy stay Luz! Much appreciated how well the communication was. Very easy and the room was tidy.,5
"11 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · April 2025 Luz was good host, responded to messages promptly, even with different time differences. Place was easy to find bus stop nearby. The room was very spacious. Had access to coffee machine and water which was great. A microwave would have been handy to have access to as there’s no access to a kitchen in this listing. Place has a dryer and washing machine in basement for extra cost of $10. Detergent provided. 👍🏽 Shared bathrooms are kept very clean. Good place to start my New York trip. Loved the door security/entrance features to the house and the bedroom. If you have a large suitcase be prepared to get creative taking it up and down the rather narrow staircase. So pleased I’ve been learning to lift weights. 😄 Would recommend this place to NJ bound travelers.",5
"awesome, affordable spot. nothing fancy but very clean and easy to get to.",5
"1 year on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · March 2025 I had a lovely stay in this cozy, clean, private room. Feels like a home away from home.",5
"my friend and I really enjoyed our stay. We went during the coldest weekend, but the room had a heater so it was all good! The restrooms were close by and even though shared, they were maintained cleaned. The only downside was that we had to climb 3 flights of stairs to get to our room, but staff were willing to help us with our bags when checking in and out :)",4
"8 years on Airbnb Rating, 4 stars , · 2 weeks ago I was surprised at how nice the apartment was maintained. There was a lot of breakfast food provided in the kitchen, which was also unexpected. Alex was very responsive throughout my stay. I would definitely stay here again for my next trip to New York. The rooms close to the entrance can get quite loud in the morning, so I suggest bringing a pair of earplugs !",4
Host was very accommodating and kind! It made our trip so much more enjoyable. The host was very responsive and didn’t miss a chance in letting us know we could always reach out to them at anytime for anything we needed! Rooms were small But comfortable and there’s a lot of great places around with access to the metro just around the corner. Great place overall!,5
"The location of the accommodation was excellent, our room was clean and surprisingly spacious. The kitchen was always fully equipped, so we could enjoy a hearty breakfast before heading out. The bathrooms looked like they were cleaned several times a day because they were always spotless. The host and the staff were extremely kind and friendly, if I ever return to New York, I would definitely stay here again! 🙂",5
Dope spot. They let you drop your stuff before check in. Cameras around the place so in case of anything so you don’t have to worry. Everyone was nice and easy to work with. When we got in Alex showed us around gave us the rules and gave us a key to go in and out when we needed. And the room was spotless and bathrooms were very nice. All in all very simple very mindful very demure.,5
"I volunteered during my stay, and it was a truly wonderful experience. Das, Goku and Ottie and the rest of the staff created a warm, compassionate, hospitable environment, and being part of their outreach made the stay especially meaningful. The space was clean, well-run, and centrally located. And the warm scones in the morning…OMG absolutely delicious! I’m grateful for the opportunity to give back and would happily stay here again.",5
"Stayed here for 3 nights and it was so enjoyable! We were planning on just dropping our bags off early and were able to get an early check in. Everything looked and smelled very clean! The shared bathroom is definitely small, but very clean. The hosts were great and very helpful, especially with carrying up our bags to the 4th floor. Would definitely stay here again!",5
"The location of the place was very ideal for me and it was fairly cheap compared to the rest of the places in the Chelsea area. If you are looking for a place that isn’t expensive but still has all of the basic things you may need, I could definitely recommend this place. Also the hosts are extremely responsive.",4
"This is a great value and in an amazing location (convenient to Penn Stations, subways, restaurants, art museums, galleries). The staff is always friendly and helpful and very considerate. This is my favorite spot to stay when visiting NYC.",5
The Interfaith is a gem of a place. I felt right at home. I loved the community kitchen and appreciated the ability to speak with whoever was working at the front desk. All of the staff was extremely kind and receptive. You can feel that their mission of being a proactive member of the community is authentic. The location made this place a wonderful place to stay. You could spend your entire time in Manhattan walking or taking the train from this great location. Plenty of public transportation and cool things to do and see nearby. I 10 out of 10 recommend. I'll be back soon.,5
"This place is wonderful! Although it has a hostel-style setup, it was exceptionally clean, and the room was both comfortable and cozy. The friendly atmosphere and beautiful and peaceful energy made me feel right at home. Definitely coming back.",5
"Fantastic location, and super kind hosts. We arrived and were immediately welcomed, and the atmosphere felt peaceful and comforting. Thank you so much for such a great stay.",5
"I had a wonderful 5-night stay here at Interfaith and I would 100% book with them again! Everyone was beyond friendly and helpful. The room was the right fit for me as a solo traveler, just enough space and the surrounding area/neighborhood was super calm at night. More so, I loved that everyone at Interfaith was so accepting of people from all walks of life and backgrounds. I also truly enjoyed helping them in their mission to spread love in their community and beyond to feed the homeless 3x a week. Unforgettable experience!",5
"4 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · January 2026 Totally worth every dollar spent, the friendliness and cleanliness was cherry on top i dont think one will find a better place than this in manhattan at this kind of price. Everyone was very helpful. The train station was 5 - 8 mins walk away. Will visit again for sure!",5
"Wonderful place to stay. The host was kind enough to let me check in early, staff is really friendly, felt very clean, public areas were cleaned frequently, cozy space, location is great. You can really feel that the host cares about your experience here and was really thoughtful about everything. The only negative would be that the bed length is a bit short if you’re tall and it could get a little noisy outside (inside was fine), but I would still stay here again for sure.",5
"Where can I even start I fell right at home. Gokul hope saying it right was super friendly as soon as I arrived helped w all my questions. Check In was amazing they offered me breakfast & everything that’s In kitchen for everyone to grab. Loved all the organic jelly’s, bread , milk and everything that was in the fridge for our use. Russ was very nice and friendly helped me with directions and I volunteer passing out food to homeless was amazing being able to do something good for others. Bathrooms were always clean & room was nice and cozy. I will definitely come back and stay here again",5
"Expensive for what you get. Very small room with shared bathroom. Nicely decorated. Some details are included in the listing such as no meat in the community fridge but after booking, the hosts request no alcohol and a sober building.",4
We immediately felt welcomed on our arrival and had a very pleasant stay! Alex was quick to respond to messages and helpful which was very appreciated. We found everything to be exceptionally clean and exactly like it was described. We would definitely stay here again on our next trip to the city!,5
"3 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · December 2025 I really loved the place!! It’s a bit old school style and small, but it felt very homey and shower room and bathroom were clean and nice! (Hot water runs well!!) Also, host and employees were nice. If you have a lot of luggages, request a ground level room :)",5
"Just got home from staying here for a few nights and it was such a lovely stay! This air bnb is great in my opinion for getting an authentic NYC experience, the building is old with charm but well cleaned and maintained. The bed was super comfortable and though the room was small it came with a sink and a raising desk so it was perfect for what we needed. Relatively close to subway stations and on a calmer residential street. I would definitely recommend staying here!",5
"The place is very clean and well appointed. It does state its a hotel, but the bathroom and shower are shared - I missed that in the details but the place was great and they were very accommodating.",5
"We adored this spot! This cute little home base near by a subway entrance was a great home base for our NYC walking tours. Everyone was so kind and accommodating, and we came to find out that they do a lot of work in their community which was so nice to see. We would definitely stay again.",5
"It was a clean and lovely place. The location was convenient for getting around, and the room was warm and comfortable. The staff were also very kind and welcoming. I would love to stay here again. Thank you for a wonderful stay! 😊",5
"Super cute neighborhood. Very kind and responsive host. Loved the all day breakfast pantry =) Reported that the shower drain was clogged and host fixed it the same day. The place is calm, soothing, and feels at home. Free all day breakfast turned out to be a life saver... Our only challenge (disclaimer: This same feature might be common among hotels in the same area. Since it was my first time in NYC I can't say that this particular hotel had the issue) would be no sound proofing. So if you're a light sleeper, do bring ear plugs and problem's solved.",4
You get what you pay for - especially for New York City and this prime location. The best perk besides location was the offer of baggage service. That was incredibly kind and convenient to keep luggage since I arrived very early,5
"Stay was just as expected from description, VERY small space but worked for what we needed on our 2 day trip. Check in instructions very clear and easy. Host was very thorough in explaining the procedures and even provided links to make it easier. Shower was clean. Location was great, right by Penn Station!",5
"I had a wonderful stay in this apartment located in the center of New York city. It is small but very convenient for solo travelers. The floor was a little dusty, but the toilet and bathroom were clean. Thank you for welcoming me!",5
"Our stay at the village house was great for a short trip into the city. It so close to MSG, where we attended a concert, and everything was in walking distance. Would def recommend!!",5
It was very nice to stay at this Airbnb Everything was cool & the host constantly send messages to ask if everything was okay We really loved the area Chelsea is really pretty & it’s very walkable,5
"Nice place, great location, very comfortable and an excellent communication with the hostes.",5
"A group of boys came into the building at 3AM clapping, yelling slurs, and stomping. They were also throwing food all over the stairs. Because I was unable to contact the host, and so I had to confront the rude guests myself. I knocked on their door and told them off, and how I had already recorded and reported them to Airbnb, and they retreated. This is a fantastic place to stay, but just understand that you will have to deal with problems like these on your own, as there is not a 24/7 phone line to contact the host/groundskeeper. Other than that, amazing location, Anthony Bourdain's favorite pizza place is right around the corner, as well as a cheap convenience store, and restaurants/bars. This listing is perfect for two people that plan to be on their feet for the majority of the trip. No common space, however there are basic living amenities, and comfy beds. When they are awake, the hosts are very responsive and reasonable. Incredible value for the location and quality.",5
"It has a perfect location—peaceful and walkable. The room is really small; I wouldn’t recommend it for two people. The Wi-Fi doesn’t work well for more than sending simple messages, so I’d suggest getting a good cellular plan. Overall, you get what you pay for. I would definitely recommend this room if you are a solo traveler on a low budget.",4
"good stay for a good price, literally the bare minimum but it's more than enough for a trip to spend the daytime exploring NYC and have a place to crash and shower. As a few others mentioned, the hallways have a pungent smell but it stays outside, inside the room smells fine. Very pleased, would stay again!",5
"It is located near the Hudson, very good location, as for the place it is quiet, both the administrator and the owner were attentive they answer sover, the room corresponded to that of the photo, the only thing I did not like is that of the fourth guest next door, the administrator went to check and you can balance the bad smell. I recommend it if you travel alone or as a couple.",4
"Pros: Great location, smooth check-in and check-out, good communication and affordable pricing. Cons: The room had an unpleasant smell, and the shared shower was very small.",4
Perfect place for young people or those who are not fussy about comfort. Very well located. The host is very proactive and makes sure everything goes well! Matches the description perfectly. I recommend it.,5
"Great location and perfect for 2 of us who are students on a budget. It matched the description and our room was clean - the hallway had an unpleasant fishy odor, however. We reported it, and it improved, but then the smell came back.",4
"Koichi's place was the perfect spot for a few days in NYC. It's small but that isn't weird for NY. There was enough room for a chair (which was imperative since you couldn't sit upright in the lower bunk), a small refrigerator, a microwave, a sink (key since there is a shared toilet) and a little plugin kettle (which was lovely as I brought some tea with me). The floor needed a sweep but besides that it was perfect for the time I needed it for. Quieter than other places I've stayed. Thank you!",4
Great stay for the price and I’m glad I chose it. It’s in an ideal location especially for those who intend to be out exploring rather than staying inside for their visit. 5* experience!,5
Tiny space but it’s very close to Penn and the javits center right in manhattan,5
"The place is definitely worth it's money, good location, convenient to get to the subway. You get what you pay for, but it's worth every penny.",5
It was very good location. it was quiet. everything very good location. was quiet. everything you needed was clean and neat.,5
"Easy check in, clean room, toilets and showers, small cute room, everything u need for a stay in newyork, but the floor had always a strong strange smell",4
"The room was clean, though there was some strange smell in the hallway. The price is reasonable in New York. You can easily get to the apartment after exit the subway.",4
"as advertised. older building, but clean. very secure. excellent instructions for entry and no waiting to get in.",4
"It's a small room, perfect for visiting New York. It is located in the center, close to everything. It's quiet and clean. The toilet and shower on the landing are not bothersome, it was always clean and available. On the other hand, the bunk bed is wooden, different from the one in the photo, and seems really unstable. It moves a lot when someone is on top and gives the impression that it could break. It looks like a child's bed, it's not strong enough for two adults! Other than that, if we don't move, we sleep well. Translated from French Show original",4
Good value for the stay,5
"Great value for money due to the location, the space is small and simple, but very clean. Very comfortable duvet. A suggestion for improvement would be the bunk bed, it is swinging and needs adjustments. Translated from Portuguese Show original",4
"Rodrigo was kind, responsive, and attentive. He was a fantastic host and I felt safe staying with him as a woman traveling on her own. His place was very clean, even had a space heater and ear plugs, clean towels, and a number of another nice touches. Thank you so much, Rodrigo!",5
"Never actually met the host in person, but instructions for getting into the apartment were clear and easy to follow. The apartment itself was very comfortable. The host was very responsive over text and seemed to be genuinely committed to making sure the stay went well. For sure a place I’ll stay at in the future if I’ll need lodging.",5
Absolutely loved this space! Rodrigo was very accommodating and communicative and even allowed me to check-in about 3hrs early due to my flight arrival! The room was super comfy and Rodrigo had the cleanest bathroom/kitchen that I’ve experienced in my AirBNB history. The only regret I have was not staying longer so I had more time to explore (was only in the city for a day trip). Thanks again for hosting me!,5
"I had a wonderful stay! Rodrigo’s apartment was clean, confortable and exactly as described in the description. The area has great options for food and night life. The location was very walkable, near the train and buses, easy to use public transportation. Rodrigo was a great and a kind host, had a great conversation and made our stay so much better!",5
Great little apartment in a great safe neighborhood. Flew into New York for day to attend Yankees game and Rodrigo's place close to a lot of cool little places plus close to LaGuardia and not too far from the Bronx. For the price couldn't beat it either. Would definitely stay here again in the future!,5
Thanks so much to Rodrigo for hosting my teenage son and I on our brief time in NYC. His place was perfect for our needs. Great neighborhood where we could get a meal after our late-night arrival. Easy public transit links to Manhattan. We’ll probably stay there again. A+. Thanks again!,5
Rodrigo was very flexible and helpful. He gave me great insides on how to use public transportation and always responded to all my questions. Place is clean and comfortable.,5
"Easy comfortable place to stay, exactly as pictured and Rodrigo was exceptional host- easy to communicate with and friendly.",5
"Needed a convenient room to stay for a night near transit. This room was perfect, and host was very responsive",5
"This is a very cute and comfortable place to stay. The room has a large desk that works great for computer work. Felt like I had a private office. Rodrigo is a great host, very friendly and helpful with good local recommendations. The area outside is very walkable with many good restaurants nearby. Highly recommend this place.",5
Rodrigo was a very nice host. He was very hospitable and he allowed me to check in earlier than expected. The bed was very comfortable and the use of the kitchen was very convenient. I loved the area and everything was nearby. I would recommend this place and most likely stay on my next trip to NYC.,5
"Rodrigo was very kind and he explained to us everything we needed to know even though we stayed only one night. The location had everything around, groceries,coffe shops,metro station 6min walk,etc. I had great sleep cuz the bed was very comfortable. Thank you Rodrigo and i will definitely book again if i ever come back to NYC!",5
I was very grateful Rodrigo helped out when changes of arrangements needed to be made due to the snow storm. The place was clean and near everything I needed.,5
"Good location, the apartment was very good, very clean. Nice host. Highly recommended",5
Great location! Easy access to Manhattan. Very nice apartment.,5
"Nice, clean apartment. Host was always available for questions. 25min to Times Square with subway ☺️",5
"It was absolutely amazing experience. Great location, easy to access, very clean and cozy home, loved the room, it was even betterthan on the pictures. Rodrigo was super friendly, helpful and respectful. Great host. Thank you very much!",5
The apartment was super cute and had eco-friendly products. AC worked great and there were several public transit options nearby. Couldn’t have asked for a better place to stay!,5
"Fantastic stay! The location is perfect, with easy access to everything. Rodrigo is incredibly friendly, helpful, and responsive. Plus, there are many great restaurants nearby that I highly recommend. Would definitely stay here again.",5
"This property was my first airbnb experience and it was absolutely great. Rodrigo was an excellent host, he was welcoming and accommodating. The property itself was immaculate and spacious. It looked exactly how it was advertised. I felt at home and it was very private. The location is great, downtown is around 30 minutes away via subway. The nearest subway station is 5 minutes away by walk. The location has many stores around it and it’s lively and I felt safe even past 10pm. I would definitely recommend this place and I will 100% be rebooking when I come to nyc in the summer.",5
"Superb stay in every way. This is our second time staying with Rodrigo, and he is the perfect host. He even loaned us an HDMI cable so I could use the large TV in our room as an external monitor for our laptop. The apartment was spotless, the kitchen is well equipped, the temperature was perfect, the bedroom is perfectly sized for a couple, and we felt very secure. The location is perfect, with restaurants, coffee shops and stores in every direction. I highly recommend Rodrigo's place.",5
"Rodrigo is a fantastic host — friendly, helpful, and welcoming!",5
Fantastic area and place! Everything was sparkling clean and smelt amazing,5
Rodrigo’s place was very nice he was very helpful even with me showing up late he still was up and accommodating even let us sleep in I appreciate that a lot thank you so much we will be back soon!!,5
"Good value but the bed base has a socket so the mattress dips into it. Besides that all was great and the location is incredible, smack dab in the very middle of Manhattan.",4
"We really enjoyed this place. There are great cafés, pizzerias and eatery nearby, it's close to everything. We were able to drop off our laundry @ a laundromat within a three minute walking distance. The building itself is newer and as a woman I felt very safe. All in all, we would stay there again . Thank you so much, Jennifer.",5
room was very clean and more spacious than expected! location is great. close to subways and walkable to many neighborhoods. room was very well cleaned which made it feel like home. bathroom was spotless. the bed was very comfortable and was able to get good sleep each night. the specific room given may not match the pictures exactly. it is a building with many units of the same size with some for airbnb and some leased to tenants. we were given a room not facing the street which was very peaceful and not loud at all.,5
"Jeniffer’s place was clean, simple, no bells or whistles. It was quiet and yet in an excellent location close to the metro and walking distance to museums, galleries, shopping. Great food and nightlife nearby. I felt very safe. It was more like a hotel room, but there’s no housekeeping service. You will also need to buy your own toilet paper and coffee filters, but for the price in that location it’s not something to complain about. I would definitely stay here again!",5
Great flat in a perfect location. Very comfortable bed Very good price We really really enjoyed our stay !,5
"This place is exactly what it looks like in the photos. It was clean and quiet and I loved the windows and view. The bed is soft, in case that is a pro or a con for you (personal choice!). I found the space to be quiet and I loved being so close to Soho. Internet worked great. All in all, a great stay. Thanks!",5
"Excellent location, the building is very clean, comfortable, and the host is very responsive and helpful. Highly recommend for anyone looking for an extended stay in an iconic part of NYC!",5
"Spent 10 days here, excellent for a work trip.",5
We loved our stay. Perfect apartment,5
Amazing place in the heart of the city. Thanks again really appreciate it Jennifer.🙏🏼,5
The studio was adorable with all the confort and a sunny balcony. Close to the subway is highly recommended,5
"The apartment is very nice, comfortable, well located, with several subway stations, markets and restaurants nearby (next to Little Italy), quiet apartment, with heater in the living room and bedroom, kitchen utensils, pots, glasses, everything necessary to stay well. Translated from Portuguese Show original",5
"Great spot near subway stations, Little Italy and Chinatown! Clean and seems new!",5
"great place, amazing location, easy check in. would stay again 1000%",5
"Perfect location and a beautiful flat. We were surprised how neat the place was. Stayed for a week and we loved it. The pentry, although small, was very useful. The roof is a cool bonus too, don't miss out on it. In general Bowery rocks too. It connects so well with everything in the city, by the Subway, by foot, or if you want to run it's fairly close to the river.",5
"We stayed here during our 2 week trip to NYC. It's smack dab in the middle of China Town and Little Italy. You have 3 subway stations within 10 minutes of the building. Easy access to navigate all throughout NYC just by using those stations. It's a great sized room for one person, a little small for two people (esp when they are both remotely working) but we made it work. Kitchenette is great to have (no photos pictured but it's there).",5
"It was a truly great stay, the process was made easier with the personal check in and we felt safe in the building. Also the presence of washing machines and driers were very convenient!",5
"The place was just as described, easy to find and access once you follow the instructions provided. Great location and views from the roof top. Also very close to a train station which made it easier and cheaper to commute.",5
"Cozy, clean, and centrally located apartment for a stay in New York/Manhattan. We had a great time here because of the great neighborhood and good connection to the train station. Thank you!",5
"We booked this apartment-hotel because we came for a long period of 12 nights for work and needed somewhere close by that has a kitchen. The pictures were very accurate and the location was perfect however there were a couple of things that were very inconvenient. The bed wasn’t so comfortable, too soft. The water pressure was very weak, and the counter top in the kitchen was very small. Otherwise the apartment was very clean, close to everything and convenient came with all the amenities and the host was very responsive and clear. Thank you",3
"9 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · March 2024 My stay was great. The lodging was clean and convenient. The location was ideal for me. The area is historically significant. Near Chinatown and Little Italy and walkable to Soho, etc. Not as upscale as Soho and Greenwich Village. I prefer the more varied lower east side.",5
"Our stay at this apartment exceeded all expectations! From the moment we walked in, we were impressed by how super clean and well-maintained everything was. The apartment had everything we needed for a 2-week stay. The location was absolutely perfect, conveniently close to everything we wanted to explore. There are a lot of nice restaurants nearby. Jennifer was responsive and friendly. We couldn't have asked for a better spot to enjoy our vacation. Highly recommend this place!",5
"6 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · October 2024 the accommodation was fantastic! I'd stay here again next time. it's just that the responses were a bit slow but overall it was great value for money.",5
Great location and amazing apartment. Communication with the host was easy and clear. I recommend and would love to come back.,5
"I am giving a 3-star review because I was not made aware until I arrived in NYC that I would be sharing the apartment with another AirBnb guest. My understanding from the listing was that I would share the space with Reka. However, during the week I was there, 2 different male guests stayed in the apartment. I wouldn't have booked if I had known this. For some solo female travelers, staring an apartment with an unknown man is a safety concern. I found Reka a bit dismissive when I contacted her about this. I think the listing needs to be more transparent.",3
"I spent my third night in NYC at Reka's place, after two nights in Queens. Reka was responsive and very reasonable even from pre-booking all the way thru check out. Her apartment is clean and alive (plants) with a great view out the window. I enjoyed the Nespresso coffee, pure water, and conversation with her. I would happily stay there again in the future. Thanks again!",5
"great little apartment in a very cute part of town! recommend! the only thing i’ll say is it does feel a bit overpriced for what you get, but what’re you gonna do it’s nyc",5
"I had a great stay and can highly recommend Reka as a host. The place is in great location, clean and as described. The check in was easy, and Reka was always responsive and friendly.",5
"I really enjoyed my stay here. It was a nice, airy and bright room in a cool apartment in an interesting and fairly laid back neighborhood. I felt very safe and at home for my 3 nights here, enjoying the local parks and community gardens in between trips further afield. The balcony was also super to hang out a little and enjoy the view. Reka was a friendly hostess and communication was always prompt, easy and helpful. I would wholly recommend staying here. Thanks Reka 😃",5
"Man oh man I really enjoyed staying at Reka’s. She always made sure to keep the place nice and clean. It’s well located near tons of bars, restaurants, and a couple of parks. Reka was also really kind. Thanks for the stay!",5
Reka was really communicative and her space was beautiful and comfortable. Overall a really great stay!,5
Reka was a lovely and communicable host. She also has some excellent friends who I was privileged to meet on my stay.,5
"8 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · December 2025 Reka was a really great host, friendly and helpful. We stayed for 5 nights and it was very comfortable and a great location. Would highly recommend.",5
"Reka’s place was a great stay for my few days in ny. the apartment is full of greenery and has a super lived in, cozy vibe. the room was simple but clean, with a closet and plenty of storage to get settled in. it was great having a kitchen to make tea in the morning, she has really cool ceramics. the neighborhood is quiet, walkable to a lot nearby and easy get to most places, not super close to the subway but I made use of the buses a lot during my stay. The downstairs area has one other bedroom and the bathroom is shared between the two rooms, I had no issues and the other guest was super nice and respectful. Would highly recommend Reka’s place as your home base in new york.",5
"12 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · August 2025 What a little gem, right near Tompkins Square Park. Reka's place was so homely, the bed was super comfy and the coffee delicious! It was really quiet, and the lift was a plus that you don't get with many places in NYC. It was great not having to lug my luggage up multiple flights of stairs. Oh, and I loved her plants :)",5
Did a trip to explore NYC for a week and staying at Rekas amazing spot in East Village was what I needed. It felt like the best part of town and very great place too with plants and AC that saved me during the heatwave! Super highly recommend if your in the city to explore and need a cozy spot to rest and enjoy NYC!,5
"Had a fantastic stay at Reka and Adam’s place! The apartment was spotless, the bed super comfy, and the shower had great water pressure. Beautiful views from the bedroom and the upstairs terrace. The location in Alphabet City was perfect – close to everything but still quiet. Would absolutely stay again!",5
Communication was proactive. The owner sent me a message that the fob/key could be picked up at the small grocery around the corner. A bonus was I was able lock my bicycle in the rear courtyard of the building - so I had no concerns of having my bicycle stolen. Note that I had to carry my bike up one flight of stairs to reach the courtyard level. Note also that the bedroom door doesn’t lock - I had no concerns about that but some people might.,5
"Loved Reka’s place in LES - the terrace has a great view! It was a great location to explore lower manhattan, and was close to a good bodega and restaurants.",5
"I stayed two nights at Reka’s home in the East Village and had a wonderful experience. The room was private, quiet, clean, and had a very comfortable bed. Although the bathroom is shared, I never saw or heard the other guest, so it felt completely private. The space was simple but thoughtfully equipped with everything you might need. The room has air conditioning, though I didn’t use it—I kept the window open, and even then it was surprisingly quiet with minimal street noise. Reka is a warm and welcoming host, an excellent communicator, and a delight to chat with. She offers just the right balance of privacy and independence while also being available to answer questions or provide helpful suggestions about the city. I felt very safe and comfortable throughout my stay. I would absolutely stay here again on my next visit to New York City.",5
Reka was very responsive. The check-in instructions were specific and helpful. The location was safe and in a quiet neighborhood.,5
"Such a cute place I wish I could have stayed longer! Everything was just as described and my short stay was perfect! Clean, nice view from the terrace, beautiful plants. Thank you!",5
I had a wonderful stay at Reka and Adam’s place. They are fantastic hosts. I had only been to NYC once and Reka made it a breeze in terms of getting to her place. She also had great travel tips for the area. The space itself was spectacular with a great view of east village and downtown. The bed was very very comfortable. The plants in their space were comforting. The rooftop terrace very peaceful. Definitely want to stay longer next time I’m in NYC. Thanks guys! -Barry,5
"This was great! Perfect location. I felt safe and close enough to the subway, restaurants, and anything else I wanted to do. The space itself was wonderful and had every amenity needed. I especially loved the terrace. Reka is a great communicator and I would definitely stay here again!",5
"I loved Reka’s place. The space was clean, comfortable, and well decorated. Location was great and it was easy to park over night. Only issue was the key pick up and drop off was far from the apartment.",5
"Reka was a great host and I would recommend this accommodation to anyone looking to stay in the East Village area! The location was walkable to public transport and other popular locations, which was nice. The room was private, comfortable, and Reka was very responsive throughout my stay.",5
"I liked my room very much and my stay was very pleasant at Reka's home. She is very accommodating to her guests. Also, I would recommend listing some additional new photos because she has made some very nice updates on her home since the last photos were taken! Fun neighborhood!",5
Reka’s place is in a great location with lots of restaurants nearby. The apartment has everything I needed for my stay and Reka was responsive to messages. I also appreciate that I was able to drop off my bag before checkin since I arrived in the morning!,5
Dave was such a warm host—very personable and helpful! He made the time there great. The room was STUNNING-so many amenities and truly private and spacious room. Everything you need to make a stay amazing. You can tell much care is taken to maintain the space for guests. Would definitely stay here again 🌞,5
Had a wonderful stay at David's property. The classic brick rowhouse in Sunnyside is beautiful on both the outside and inside. Room is spacious and cozy. Bed's comfy and I especially loved the location which is a short walk from the subway station. Would stay here again when I'm in NY next time!,5
"We were thrilled at how convenient and interesting the location was to access the city and locally delicious restaurants. Our host David was very personable, attentive and able to offer good suggestions and directions whenever we needed them. Staying at this location we felt like there was always someone available who could answer our questions or needs at any time. Thank you David! We will be back🤗",5
"David is an excellent host. The room was clean, the house was super close to the train station as well, and his communication was excellent —he was super responsive to anything you asked. He is a friendly host and I would recommend his place to anyone who needs a room to stay in New York.",5
loved the place. David is quick in responding. he is great hosts and thoughtful of the guest need. Room is nice. the bed is little small for 2 people to sleep . location wise it's only 5 - 10 mins walk from subway. the house is located in quite neighbourhood,5
"I would definitely recommend this rental to my friends that would want to visit NYC. The room is very nice, clean and well equipped, and David is a very nice host. But on top of this the location is perfect, very close to the subway station and Manhattan, and in a very peaceful and nice area.",5
David is very communicative and really wants his guests to have the most comfortable stay possible. The room is spacious and the neighborhood feels quiet and safe. It’s also a great deal for NYC and really nice to have thoughtful hosts on top of that!,5
"This place is an absolute gem!!! Everything about it. The location is spot on. Nice to be out of the city, but also so easy to travel in. Peaceful neighbourhood! Pete’s diner is a must for breakfast/lunch/dinner. We ate here regularly. The apartment room is super cozy, so many extras that dave has installed. Mini fridge, coffee machine with coffee pods, tea, hot chocolate m, Ferrero Roche. Smart TV, Netflix, Amazon Prime. The room itself was unbelievably warm and cozy. To spend long days in the freezing December/January weather and then come back here, it was bliss🥰. Shared bathroom again was spotless. Also a shared kitchen, with plenty of usage space if required. Dave is an amazing guy. Always available for any questions, or to offer any advice. We had the best time. And Sunnyside, Queens is hands down the best place to stay in NYC. We can’t wait to return!!! Thanks Dave ☺️",5
"We've been at David's place for more than two weeks and had a really good time there. We weren't there to work but it's still really cool to have this second little room, the small fridge is also very convenient since we didn't want to go to restaurants for every meal. Even though the bathroom is shared, we never waited long for our turn. The area is great to visit, Manhattan is 15min away with the line 7, and since Manhattan can be very crowded and loud, it was good to go back to a quieter place after a long day. There's a cool coffee called Moa Coffee on the way to the subway station. We highly recommend David's place!",5
"This is a good value. David and Tony were kind and hospitable. The 40th & Lowery stop was very convenient, a 5 minute walk and only 15-20 minutes to Manhattan. I enjoyed going to a local Thai restaurant and a diner nearby. The room was clean and pleasant, also has a great tv! They brought me a fan because the room was warm when I arrived. I would recommend David's place, and would like to return.",4
"Thank you so much to David and Tony. We've been stay as comfortable as home. David and Tony, very kind and sweet. The location is perfect and there are many amenities nearby. We also enjoyed the delicious restaurant with friendly neighbors. I can't wait next time New York. I hope see you again on our next time!🥰",5
"Thank you David and Tony for the wonderful stay at your place ! You completely deserve your title of superhost. The room was lovely, clean and cosy with everything we needed included. The neighbourhood was super quiet and very easy access to all Manhattan, Brooklyn (Williamsburg/ Greenpoint) and Queens. You were always available if we needed anything and that's always a bonus to feel very well. Take care :)",5
"David and Tony were absolutely wonderful hosts. We felt spoiled with how accommodating they were, from helping us get parking- even offering to even save it for us if we didn't make it in time to grab a good spot- to giving us plenty of space and privacy our entire stay. We will definitely be coming back!",5
"David was always responsive, easy to communicate. Room just looked like pictures and the decorations and the interior were so cute!",5
Nice room in a quiet area 5 minutes walk from the subway which takes you directly to Times Square and Grand Central.,5
"HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, 10/10. This accommodation was an excellent choice for a trip to NYC. The location isn’t on Manhattan, but just a short distance away — about a 5-minute walk to the elevated train station, and you can be in the center of Manhattan in roughly 25 minutes. The neighborhood has everything you need: grocery stores, restaurants, cafés, fast food places, bars, and pubs. Plus, Queens itself is full of things to discover. The room was outstanding — very comfortable bed and all the amenities (towels, toiletries, hairdryer, electric kettle, safe, huge LED TV with soundbar, private fridge). Shared spaces (bathroom, kitchen) were also clean and problem-free. The host was excellent — attentive, regularly checked in, and made sure I had everything I needed. Truly thoughtful and caring.",5
This was an excellent AirBnB stay and I highly recommend it for others! David was extremely responsive and friendly and wanted to make sure that our stay went great. The room was a lovely place to stay and a very good deal for the location. Will certainly look to book again when I return to NY.,5
"I was in town for the bar exam and needed quiet and comfort above all else. I definitely had that and plenty of space to study. There was a mini fridge in the room which I appreciated and hotel type extras like coffee, tea, shampoo etc. The host cares and it shows. I would definitely stay again !",5
"As a solo traveler, I couldn’t have asked for a better place to stay. David’s home in Queens was peaceful, clean, and felt very safe—precisely what I was looking for. The location was perfect, just a short walk to the subway, which made getting around the city super convenient. The neighborhood was quiet and felt welcoming, even when coming back late in the evening. David was a kind and attentive host, ensuring I had everything I needed. I truly enjoyed my stay and would come back again. Highly recommended for anyone traveling alone or just looking for a calm, comfortable place to stay!",5
"Amazing location, felt very safe walking back from the subway at night, no issues whatsoever. So many different restaurants, delis and supermarkets in the area, never stuck for anything! The room was spacious and comfortable, I really enjoyed watching Netflix after a long day of walking around NYC. My hosts were amazing! Tony even drove me to City Hall at 5am in the morning for the Brooklyn Bridge so I wouldn't have to use the subway! So responsive, friendly and went above and beyond for my stay. I can't wait to come back",5
"Thank you for the lovely stay! The hosts were absolutely lovely—so warm, welcoming, and helpful. The room was super cozy, clean, and had such a peaceful, homey atmosphere. It’s in a quiet area, but still just a 20-minute subway ride from Times Square, with the nearest station only about a 7-minute walk away. There were so many thoughtful little touches—like chocolates and tea and soft country music playing from the TV when arriving. Already looking forward to coming back! :)",5
"Perfect base for your stay in New York! You pay much less than in Manhattan and you can get to the main attractions in 20 minutes. Very safe area. Room and bathroom nice comfortable and spacious. Tony is very nice and helpful, he does everything to make your stay pleasant :)",5
"I had the most peaceful week at David’s! The location was convenient and easily accessible to transportation. He was kind, easy to communicate with and gave plenty of sweet treats. Thank you so much for hosting me at your lovely home ♥️",5
"David’s place was a 10/10 of what was expected and needed. Safe environment, clean and quiet space, easy access to public transportation. Would definitely recommend and look forward to staying there again.",5
"a nice cozy room to stay in manhattan. she left snacks and drinks in the room, and it was neat. short walk to the train station to get downtown, so that was convenient. we were doing a day trip so we just needed a place to freshen up mid-day. if you’re looking to be out late, don’t expect it to be easy because there was a “building curfew”. regardless, I would stay here again.",5
"4 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · January 2026 Fining Joo’s place was a miracle I’d say! NYC is super duper expensive and we found this right after new year on 2nd for such less rates. Such spacious and clean room with shared kitchen and bathroom! She even left us few snacks and drinks. So sweet of her. Basically hotel comfort for fraction of a cost. As she has clearly mentioned it’s on 4th floor and no lift so this place is a gift for ones who can climb hehe. Can’t recommend this enough ! Would give 6 stars if I can!",5
"Staying at Joo Hee’s apartment was an amazing choice. Honestly I could say it was so much better than I expected. The place, not far from Central Park was close to a metro train station and was quite easily accessible. Joo Hee was very friendly and even left us snacks and drinks. We are really grateful for the generosity and friendliness and absolutely recommend this place. Totally worth the price.",5
"We had a wonderful stay at this place. The host was very thoughtful and even prepared complimentary snacks, instant noodles, and drinks for us. The house was spotless and well-maintained, and the three-layer password locks made us feel very safe. Communication was smooth and entirely online, and although we didn’t meet the host in person, everything went perfectly. Overall, it was a great experience and we would highly recommend this place.",5
"Our stay was great! The apartment is conveniently located near the Line 6 subway station, which made getting around the city very easy. Check-in was simple and smooth. The room is very spacious — we could open all our suitcases on the floor without any issue — and the air conditioning kept the temperature comfortable. The bed was cozy and we slept very well. The host was extremely kind to offer her own room so that our family could stay more comfortably. Overall, it was an excellent value for money in Manhattan, and we definitely recommend this place.",5
We had a nice time staying at Jo's place. It was close to the subway stop. Joo was very kind and responsive and accommodated us very well.,5
"Joo Hee was a very responsive and responsible host. She ensured that check-in was smooth and gave clear instructions, and her husband even received us. Refreshments were given which was very pleasant as we had just arrived. Location was great, just 2 streets down from the metro. Will definitely recommend this location for anyone looking to explore Manhattan! :)",5
"Stayed five nights with my teenage son. Easy walking distance to the subway and there’s a great Mexican place just around the corner. Joo Hee was very communicative, gave clear instructions, and responded quickly to questions. She even provided lots of different snacks and drinks, which was a lovely surprise.",5
"Amazing deal for a stay in Manhattan! We stayed here for about a week and appreciated the close proximity to the subway station. Joo Hee provided two blankets per bed, which helped us stay nice and cozy during our nights in late-winter NYC! Although we were unsure about staying in Harlem we felt just fine minding our own business and even found local businesses we loved.",5
"Everything was amazing, 100% recommended. The 110 metro station is nearby and accessible to all stations. The beautiful Central Park is just three blocks away. y muchos restaurantes mexicanos cerca",5
"Absolutely great! Really loved Joo Hee‘s place! She was texting back immediately, the apartment is very clean, the room is big and got everything you need. She even provided some snacks and drinks - awesome. Right by the Subway station, quiet neighborhood. Absolutely recommend staying here!",5
Instructions to check in were easy to follow and the unit was cleaned throughout our stay!,5
"We felt like home ! Joo and Young were very kind and responsive for any of our queries . They even provided complimentary snacks and drinks on our arrival. 1. Easy access to subway ( No 6 ) 2. Even thought the street could be noisy sometimes , we never heard anything inside the apartment.",5
"Joo’s place was exactly as described. Very responsive and helpful. There were lots of snacks, drinks and water as mentioned. The bed was comfortable, easy location to get around, the shower head was very nice and plenty of hot water. Plenty of towels provided. Room stayed a comfortable temperature even though it was 38° out. It was quiet considering where you are in NYC! The price is good for what it is. If you are a neat freak, you should get a hotel. For the rest of us, everything that matters was clean. I would stay there again for the location (easy access to museum row and central park), the friendly vibes and it was pretty quiet.",5
"If you're looking for a safe, comfortable home away from home while visiting New York, which is well connected to transit, then Joo Hee's apartment is the place to stay. We couldn't have been happier with how easy it was to find, to check-in, and with all of the amenities available that made our visit to New York so comfortable. Joo Hee is so friendly and responsive. And the apartment was exactly as described. Wonderful snacks and drinks left for us and just overall a fantastic experience. If we come back, Joo Hee's place will be at the top of the list! Can't recommend enough, thank you so much!",5
"Extremely well located accommodation 2 steps from the metro exit and close to central park. Joyeux Hee left snacks upon arrival, chips, noodles, sodas and 2 bottles of wine. It was very much appreciated. Our departure flight was at the end of the day and she agreed to leave the apartment for us until the afternoon. A big thank you to her. If I come back to New York, I'll stay at her place. Translated from French Show original",5
"Our stay at Joo Hee’s place was nothing short of incredible. From the moment we arrived, everything was smooth, spotless, and thoughtfully arranged. The room was cozy, clean, and exactly as described—if not better! Joo Hee went above and beyond to make us feel welcome, leaving complimentary snacks and drinks and providing detailed instructions that made check-in effortless. The location is also perfect for exploring NYC, with easy access to public transport and great local spots nearby. The building felt very secure, and we appreciated the safety reminders Joo Hee shared. Her communication was always prompt, kind, and helpful. This was one of the best Airbnb experiences we’ve had—comfortable, convenient, and hosted with genuine care.

Happy with my stay. I will book again.,5
The place was so clean and spacious! Love the snacks she leaves for you😊,5
"lovely place, amazing deal for the money. Joo was an extremely helpful and responsive host, and I would happily recommend anyone stay at her place",5
"I don't know if there's such a good value in New York. Joo hee answers you and arranges things for you within the hour: perfect communication. The apartment is clean, access to the kitchen simple and efficient. The location 3 minutes from metro 6 (110str) is very convenient. We returned by metro until 11 p.m. without any worries in the area. Both beds are comfortable, the fridge is nicely filled with drinks and cupcakes upon arrival. Joo hee offered to store our luggage as we had a late plane: thank you again. In one word: GREAT Translated from French Show original",5
"Joo Hee is an excellent host, she always keeps in touch and makes you feel at home. The apartment is a block and a half from the subway line and that makes it easy to get around Manhattan. Near the apartment there are many stores for everything you need, food, drink, there are a couple of nice pubs. Arrival is pleasant because JooHee leaves snacks and drinks, which help make your stay warm. I would definitely come back. Thank you Translated from Spanish Show original",5
"Beautiful apartment, large spaces! We had free access to all areas of the home. We didn't meet our host and we felt very free and comfortable. Overall the accommodation is clean but the kitchen may need a little more cleaning. The neighborhood is not the best in Manhattan in terms of visitors (we were 3 girls) but the accommodation is well located right next to subway 6. Joo Hee is an extremely responsive host and met all our needs. Thank you very much! Translated from French Show original",4
"Petra was an amazing host! She was so sweet and accommodating!! She offered me a scarf because it had been snowing and she made us coffee in the mornings. One of the days we were there, it had snowed and we were going to stay in and she encouraged us to still go out and do a little bit of sightseeing which was so nice of her to do because we wouldn’t have seen how beautiful the city looks with the snow!!",5
The place was nice and clean and very peaceful . It was so quiet I didn’t even realize it was New York. I enjoyed the living room and the clean bedroom and bathroom. Felt like a luxury experience . She was truly kind and made sure to be helpful. I advise you choose this air bnb!,5
"This was my first time visiting NYC, and I honestly couldn’t have asked for a better experience. The location was perfect—just a quick 4-minute walk to the subway—making it super easy to get around. The host was incredibly welcoming and always happy to answer any questions I had. The room looked exactly like the photos, and the shared spaces, especially the bathroom, were always spotless. On top of that, it was such a relief to find a place that didn’t break the bank. I’m already looking forward to planning another trip and staying here again. Can’t wait for future visits! Do not miss out!",5
"Absolutely lovely host. Room was clean and house was easy to navigate to. Local area was convenient and we had no problems, everyone we spoke to was lovely. Incredible transport links to all of NYC and close to a mall for easy food/shopping. Will definitely stay here again if we visit NYC in the future.",5
"Our stay was smooth and enjoyable. Petra provided clear and accurate instructions, which made everything easy, and she was always responsive to our questions. She even prepared coffee for us, which was a thoughtful gesture. We truly appreciated her hospitality and would gladly recommend staying here.",4
Great stay! Very cozy and neat apartment just 5 mins away from the trains. The hosts were very nice and quick to respond to me with any questions I had. It was easy to get in and out of the space and I would def stay here again!,5
"6 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · October 2025 Lovely stay. Petra gives a very good description of how to get to the accommodation and is lovely to talk to and very welcoming. The room is spacious and we were even able to do some washing.",5
The check in was very easy and the flat was really nice. It's close to the metro and easy to get into Manhattan. The bed is very comfy. It did feel slightly intimidating walking at night near there when not used to it.,4
"We had an amazing time staying at Petra’s place! She was an incredibly kind and thoughtful host, and everything was just perfect. The apartment was clean, cozy, and had everything we needed. Petra made us feel truly welcome, and her hospitality went above and beyond our expectations. We can’t wait to visit New York again and stay at her place once more. Highly recommended!",5
"Good stay, nice room. Great communication from friendly host.",4
Petra was very kind when I spoke with her and it was very easy to locate and find her place! definitely would book again.,5
Petra was very nice. The room was super comfortable would definitely book with her again.,5
Petra was a great host and was very responsive. The area nearby is a bit noisy during the night but the place overall is worth the value.,5
"My husband and I came here to do a small intimate pregnancy shoot. Petra introduced herself right away and helped us get the few essentials we needed to bake our cake while we took candid shots. Beyond that, as much as it was a shared space she allowed us to use it completely uninterrupted. The place was spotless and as stunning as the pictures! Omg they all came out so well! Would recommend this place a million times over and will definitely return for the next shoot since we love the theme !",5
"My wife and I were satisfied with our room and the kitchen and bathroom we shared with Petra and her partner. The room was spacious and clean, as were the kitchen and bathroom. The distance to downtown Manhattan was quite long by subway, but we got used to it. Overall, it was good value for money.",5
"Petra was super friendly and gave us some good recommendations for the neighborhood. This was our very first time in NYC so at night the area felt a little sketchy, but we didn’t face any problems.",5
Petra was a great host! My wife and I enjoyed our stay in New York at a very affordable price! Offered great advice to use the public transportation to get where we wanted to do and told us about some great areas to go to and eat! Great stay!,5
We had a nice stay at Petra’ place. Petra was communicative and helpful. Although location is a bit far away. It is easily reachable by public transportation. The place definitely worths what we paid for.,5
"I had a good stay with Petra. The apartment was close to a Subway station (5-7mins walking) and if you're looking for good and cheap Latino food, Bronx is the best option. Petra was friendly and easy to talk, and the bathroom/bedroom were clean and nice to stay.",5
Petra is a great host. Everything ist perfect. Zero complaint!,5
Thank you for allowing us to stay!,4
"We stayed 6 nights over New Year's Eve and New Year with Petra and it was beautiful! The apartment is clean, well equipped and the room spacious. Bed was very comfortable, private fridge and large mirror were super practical. The walk to the subway was short and we were also in the city. Petra is super friendly and happy to help with questions about New York. We will definitely be back! Translated from German Show original",5
Super nice host!! So friendly and amazing! Love Petra!!,5
Petra was very responsive and was an amazing host!,5
"Great stay! We had a wonderful experience with both the host and the property. The instructions provided were very clear and detailed, which made check-in completely hassle-free. The house was clean, comfortable, and well-kept. All the basic amenities—like towels, body wash, and other essentials—were thoughtfully provided. Overall, a great stay and would happily book again!",5
My first night wasn’t what I expected as the couple staying in room #7 were arguing extremely loud they appeared to be drinking because it really got louder as the evening progressed and they had music playing really loud I figured the representative on site would do something about it but unfortunately it never happened they finally quieted down around 4:00 am and thank God they checked out that morning,5
"I would highly recommend this location if you’re on a budget and want to be close to the city. Safe neighborhood, beautiful views of Manhattan, and only a short bus ride away!",5
"A really good option for people trying to see NYC. 1 min walk to the bus stop that goes into the city and the Manhattan skyline view. Kitchen and Restroom are well maintained. Bring sleeping masks, parts of the blinds are broken.",3
walking distance to everything u need. close to a bus stop too that take u right to the city and close to a crazy beutifal view of the city! highly recommend ill be back!,5
"We had a great stay and really enjoyed this place. The space was clean, comfortable, and exactly as described in the listing. The host was responsive and made check-in and check-out very easy. The location was convenient and quiet, which made it easy to relax after a long day. We’d definitely stay here again and would recommend it to anyone visiting the area. Just two things that needs to be considered are 1) there is one washroom shared among 3 rooms and so weekday mornings might be a little bit of a challenge and 2) the rooms I stayed in is relatively smaller than the other two rooms but was priced exactly the same as the other rooms. Overall, amazing place to stay.",5
"This location was very good and affordable compared to New York City. The bus stop is literally a two minute walk which was perfect and a 15 minute bus ride to New York City Port Authority bus terminal, and that connects you to the subways. The room is small and only fits two people like the description. I don’t mind it but if you don’t like small spaces, I wouldn’t recommend the restrooms are shared so I would bring sandals that way you don’t have to step around. Overall, it was a good day and there was shower gel provided in case you forgot definitely worth the price if you’re on a budget. Instructions were very easy and clear. Thank you for a great time.",5
"Good location. The neighbourhood is quiet and peaceful, and I can see the amazing view of Manhattan for just a few minutes on a walk. Also, there are a few bus routes that I can take to the Manhattan City Center. The host is helpful during our stay. I had a great time during my trip to New York.",5
Maahi was an excellent host who promptly responded to my queries. The space was worth for its price. It was easy to commute to NYC as well and easy to locate. Would recommend if youre looking for an affordable accommodation option :) Thanks Maahi!,5
"The place was just as described, cozy room in a clean apartment. The room had everything we needed, including an iron, hair dryer and toiletries! It's also very close to the bus stop and close to parks with great views of New York.",5
"Really nice location to have access to Manhattan, many buses one street away from the flat. The flat itself was ok, but we didn't especially spent much time there and the room we had (6) a little small. It was clean.",5
"Very nice airbnb, shared bathroom and kitchen but never had any problems with this. Bus is a one minute walk and they came every 5 minutes. 20 min bus ride to the centre. Perfect option if you don’t have the budget to stay in the center.",5
"The place is great, detailed explanation how to find it and how to enter. Walls are thin though, I can hear a couple from another room having great sex 😅",5
"We had a great experience staying at Maahi’s air bnb. It was clean, and exactly what we expected. A great price for a great place.",5
Nice place. It is within a five minute walk of a nice view of the New York skyline. Would come again.,5
"Our first time stay in this area. Surprisingly easy to go to town. We now prefer to stay in this area compared to Manhattan. Relax, chill and feel safe. The room is a bit small for two of us to be honest, but hey, we chose it coz we have to save. The room is however not fully conceal from the noisy from the road. We still could sleep at night with no issue coz the area is very quiet at night. The kitchen is full and complete. Superb. We wish if it could have washing machine and dryer. Having said that, laundry is stone throw away. Supermarket is also very near. We get all we need here. The best part we can enjoy the beautiful of Manhattan from this side, day and night.",5
If you want easy access to the city this is definitely the spot for you. The bus is nearby to get you to the city in minutes. Also there is multiple lots to park your car if needed (though you need to pay but you can do it all via your phone). Everything is walkable and the place is really easy to find. The room was pristine and very inviting. The air conditioning was even on for me before I got there and I found that really kind and sweet.,5
"We stayed three nights with my girlfriend to visit NYC. Maahi's place was very welcoming and not too far away from the city, although keep in mind that it uses a different transport company than NYC itself but easily understandable. We had no issues whatsoever during our stay and when we did have a question we usually got an answer within 10 minutes ! Would recommend this place and this host.",5
"Maahi was very nice to us. We arrived a little early before check-in, and she let us in. We asked for an extra cover because it was a bit cold, and she gave it to us right away. The house was always very clean, and I loved the tea and coffee in the kitchen area. Definitely coming back if I visit New York again!",5
My stay at maahi were completely wonderful warm comfortable and relaxing it were awesome love ❤️ it,5
"Quiet, cozy and tidy place. Clear indications, you can see that it is a safe place too.",5
The accommodation in West New Yoks is great for exploring the city. The room is very cosy and clean.,5
"Recommend place. Traveling to Manhattan is easy and fast from this place. And, a great host.",5
"Thanks Maahi for hosting me at your place! The place was really good and clean, and it was a 1-minute walk to the bus station and a 1-minute walk to an amazing view of Manhattan",5
"Everything was perfect! The instructions were very clear and easy to follow. It was a bit noisy from outside, but considering the location, it’s completely understandable. The place is also close to many attractions.",5
It was a perfect midtown location. Walking distance to Times Square and the train and bus station,5
"It’s a great place in a great location! You can use your phone to remotely unlock the doors. When we visited, the unit wasn’t crowded but there is only one bathroom for every unit, so when it’s more crowded, it may take more time to use the bathroom! However everything was really clean and the bidet was a nice touch. There is no sink in the suite however; so be aware of that.",5
"Paula was an amazing, responsive host. The space was bigger than I expected and very clean. It is in a noisy area, especially on the weekends, but there were earplugs left for us if we needed them. Sharing the bathroom was no problem, and the building felt very secure. Would book again 100%!",5
"I stayed 3 nights at Paula’s and had a good stay! Pros: - very central location. You can walk anywhere, the metro is close and you also have an airport shuttle in the next street - Paula is very responsive so communication is smooth - flat was very clean (always nice!) Do note: - you will need to sleep with ear plugs as the room is directly on the street. - flat is on the first floor with no lift (not an issue for me with just a carry on) - check in time is pretty late (after 4pm) with no possibility to store luggage before or after check out.",5
"Thanks, Paula. We had a great experience. The place is in an excellent location, close to several stations, great restaurants, and plenty of activities within walking distance. The place is always clean and tidy. Thank you!",5
Paula was very kind and accommodating. Location was great and very easy to find with detailed instructions. The room was nice and would definitely stay there again in the future. Thanks again Paula!,5
"Very spacious room with an amazing walk-in closet (handy if you have luggage to put away), very nice wood floor, inviting decor. I got help readily on the phone turning on the heat (the remote was a little tricky). The room includes a coffee maker and water boiler, I requested cutlery and a toaster which were delivered to the door. There is some noise from the street but I didn't find it disruptive (I do always bring ear plugs) and it goes down late night. The bed was comfortable and I had a restful night. The shared bathroom is very nice with good water pressure.",4
The space was great! Paula was very responsive and on top of things. Great restaurants and bars in the area. Highly recommend!!!,5
Very accommodating hosts. Great location for access to public transportation. Street noise is all night so if you’re a light sleeper it’s not good rest.,4
"Paula sends a link that allows easy remote access to the entrance, floor, and room doors, all of which can be opened with a tap.""",5
Great stay - 5 stars. I would absolutely stay again. Highly recommend!,5
Nice clean Airbnb. Bathroom was super nice too despite being shared. Heating was essential for the cold days I stayed. Easiest check in/check out experience I've had. Was very accommodating for the street noise given they were clear about that issue in the desc. I do recommend bringing noise cancelling headphones and you'll be golden.,5
"Paula was very responsive and was able to have my room available an hour before originally noted. The directions were very clear. The room is in the heart of midtown so if you want quiet, this is likely not the room for you. But if you want hyper local and accessible to everything (because of its distance to Columbus Circle Metro) then stay here.",5
"I really enjoyed my time in NYC and thanks to Paula I felt safe right at home at the apartment. The room is cozy, pillows and towels are super nice, and you can find everything you need in the bathroom and kitchen. Also, Paula is a kind and attentive host and will always respond very quickly. I will definitely stay with her again when I'm in the city :)",5
You feel like a New Yorker staying here!,5
"The location was excellent, it was easy to find and we liked the technology to enter. The place was very comfortable and sufficient for the experience. Although they detailed the issue of outside noise, we were not affected by this. As a small detail, I would say that we didn't find where to fill the bottle of water and we needed that. A place very well connected to the city and the subway. Highly recommended. Translated from Spanish Show original",5
"The place was clean & the host was communicative, but two things were problems for us. The big issue was that the place stinks of air sprays and strong perfumes. It was so intense that we felt sick from it (and I'm used to those things from travel). (The sad thing is that she probably doesn't know that synthetic scents, frebreeze, and all those sprays & plug-ins are cancerous & cause infertility, etc.) The place was fine. The area was where we needed to be.",5
"Accomodations were as advertised. I appreciated the privacy and easy in and out check in and check out were a breeze. Paula has a good setup. Most importantly, the room air conditioning worked well. Thank you",5
"Paula's place was cute and easy to find. There are two units and I initially went to the wrong one, but Paula was readily accessible and helped direct me. The place was exactly what I needed to attend a work meeting two blocks away.",5
"I liked my stay overall! Paula was very nice and the room was clean. I had hard time carrying my bag to the 4th floor, but as I was aware that there wouldn’t be an elevator, it was just my choice. I also loved it being very close from central park.",5
"I spent 10 days staying at Paula's apartment. The location is wonderful, very accessible and with great restaurants nearby. What pleased me most was the cleanliness of the apartment, everything was very organized and smelling good. Paula was very helpful when I needed any help and responded very quickly. Despite the room facing the avenue, I confess that I didn't have any problems with noise, I was able to sleep perfectly. I highly recommend it! ps: for those who like HIMYM, the restaurant where was recorded the sitcom is on the street next door",5
Accomodation by Paula was perfect location near central park and times square Paula was helpfull room very clean bath room and kitchen also with all what we need Perfect,5
Very central location is absolutely amazing! Really great price-value. Room is simple but comfortable. I had a very good stay with Paula and would definitely recommend and come back again! :),5
Great affordable place to stay in Astoria! About 10 min walk to public transport & in the middle of a quiet neighborhood. I’d recommend to any solo or couples traveling to NYC and wanting a place to stay that doesn’t cost a fortune! Valentin was very attentive and proactive in communication; we had a pleasant experience and would stay here again. Thank you!,5
"Valentin is amazing and very responsive and helpful! Would highly recommend this spot if you're looking to stay in Queens. living area/ kitchen was well kept, same with the room. Other tenants were quiet and respectful. Thanks Valentin!",5
"Excellent stay! Just a 10-minute walk from the N train, and the neighborhood is safe and quiet. As long as you’re okay with a shared bathroom (which I was), this place is a great option!",5
"This apartment had a great location and price. I was really close to the city, and was able to be somewhere comfortable and convenient for my stay. I really appreciate the host!",5
Valentin’s place is perfect for anyone looking to explore NYC. It was sooo convenient getting to Manhattan due to it being close to subway station. There’s also so many good food places walking distance from there. Place was also very clean.,5
"I really liked the fourth location. It was comfortable, well located, and easy to get around.",5
"Valentin's place was very clean, and a 10-minute walk to the train into Manhattan. It's perfect for a quick stay where you'd mostly be out, and just need a place to sleep and shower. Great little kitchen that I didn't need to use; perfect to eat last night's leftovers. The neighborhood felt fairly safe; I had no issues coming back around 10pm-12am. The room itself had solid basics, and a fairly comfy medium-firm mattress. The hot water temp and water pressure in the shared bathroom was excellent for a winter stay, when the outside weather was 20-40F. The address I received initially was different than the one I received closer to the trip; I was told that was due to an Airbnb error. That made my commute into Manhattan slightly longer, but I was able to adjust. Our communication had a rough start, but Valentin's responsiveness smoothed over a few small issues.",4
"A solid place to stay for a quick night before a flight. Thin walls means that if you're neighbor is talking at night, you're gonna hear it, so bring ear plugs. That's the only major knock against it.",4
"Great room with easy access to Manhattan. It was comfortable and clean, check in was easy and flexible and Valentin was responsive and proactive to questions.",5
It was great to stay at Valentin's place. Very close to the public transport and easy to get around.,5
The room is nice. Bathroom is shared by three rooms. nice spacious kitchen. Bathroom is kind of outside the living space and across the stairs.,4
A nice quiet place to stay in a comfortable apartment. The host was helpful with special requests.,5
The location and room were good. The address that was originally posted wasn’t accurate which made the check in process confusing. But other than that it was a good stay.,4
Amazing stay for NYC. The apartment is very close to the train and allows for quick and easy access to both Manhattan and the airport. The check in directions were very clear and everything went smoothly. The space is very open and the kitchen and restroom have everything you would need. The bedroom is spacious and bright with a very comfy mattress. The area is very safe and quiet with lots of families and young people. Overall the stay was amazing and the host was very friendly and proactive. I will definitely try to re-book next time I’m in NYC.,5
"I had an amazing accommodation experience during my recent trip. The location was also perfect, close to all the major attractions yet peaceful enough to relax in after a busy day of sightseeing. It was truly a memorable experience, and I would definitely stay there again.",5
The location of this stay was great! Super easy to get into Manhattan.,5
"Smaller size room with minimum open space as bed occupies most of it. Room has a single window, when opened you're able to touch the wall of another adjacent apartment building, making daylight non-existent. Quality of bedding extremely low, firm inexpensive mattress making sleep uncomfortable, same goes for pillows and blanket. Communication with host has to be in writing via airbnb only, host demonstrated negative attitude when I called contact number. All written communication with host were more of a template responses including final message asking not to leave any lesser than a five star feedback. The only positives going for this property is a quite location.",2
"Fantastic spot, Lovely area and a spacious common area, Everything was great, Would stay again",5
Valentin was an amazing host! Always very quick to respond. His place was amazing and will definitely look to book again when traveling to NY!,5
Had a great stay! Check in was super easy and made my trip easier for taking the train to get around due to the location. Highly recommended,5
"Good location, for the price, quiet and safe neighborhood. Hard communication, place looks different on photos. Room clean, bathroom and toilet not so much.",3
Perfect place to stay,5
it was a good stay! they held onto our bags before check in time and the room itself was quiet and cozy. it was clean but there were some stains in the carpet that made me a little wary. they also don't have a free water fountain but they have a convenience store downstairs during certain hours. overall good price for this time of the year! very close to popular spots,4
"Had a great stay at the Shoreham. It seemed that there was always someone downstairs, the location really was outstanding, and, though it may seem small, the staff brought towels for us very quickly. The room was small but bigger than expected and fitted our needs: a place to sleep, shower, and keep our stuff. Would recommend to anyone looking for a more lowkey housing option when visiting New York.",5
"The Shoreham met most of our expectations and exceeded our expectations in some areas. Location, location, location. If you are looking for value in a hotel, walkable to all the iconic spots in New York, this is the hotel for you. Although the bathroom was small, it was functional for our needs. The bedroom was larger than expected with plenty of space for luggage and relaxing. We will come back again next summer!",5
"Great place in walking distance to every place I needed to be, and close enough to central park for an evening and morning walk. Exactly as in the pictures and as described, easy and clear check in instructions, and great communication from the host. The place was surprisingly spacious, especiallyfor NYC, and very clean. 10/10, definitely recommend and would stay again.",5
Good location. Nice customer service. Room is clean. Nice luggage room. Near convenient store and subway station. No water bottles at arrival. Bathroom is a little too small. No hot water for 2nd day for shower.,4
"9 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · November 2025 Fantastic place to stay. The hotel is lovely and the location is perfect, being between 5th and 6th Aves and a short walk to Times Square. I stayed here Thanksgiving Eve and in the morning I just had to walk to the end of the street to view the Macy’s Parade. Highly recommend the hotel.",5
"Me and my boyfriend stayed at the Shoreham Hotel for one night. The hotel was clean and well-maintained, and the receptionist was friendly and extremely helpful, addressing every request with a smile. They even let us leave our luggages there for a few hours after check out. Its location was unbeatable, right in the heart of the city, making it easy to explore nearby attractions and enjoy the vibrant atmosphere of Manhattan. Overall, a solid choice for a stay in the city!",5
"Great hotel for budget conscious travelers that want to stay in the heart of the city. The hotel was very clean and well organized. The room was actually rather large for NYC, and the amenities were good. An amazing deal for those that want to stay in the city and be close to everything. Would definitely stay again!",5
"The hotel was ok for the cost. The room itself was fairly spacious, if a little bare bones. We did have an issue with the toilet running which we informed the front desk about, but they did not get anyone in to fix it. We also tried to call down to the front desk to get fresh towels at one point and they did not answer.",3
"First time booking a hotel via Airbnb and was a bit nervous to do so. I took the chance (seeing other’s reviews) and wow, so worth it! Check-in was a breeze, accommodated early bag check so we could get started on our early morning NYC adventure. Staff was courteous and the centralized location is unbeatable, close proximity to subways and we were up and down the city within minutes. Would DEFINITELY stay again 😊",5
"the only thing was our room didn't have a fridge. when we checked in we were not offered to upgrade for $25 for the stay for a fridge.the location was perfect, the room was clean, staff extremely helpful with suggestions for restaurants, shopping, how to get around the city and how to navigate the subway.",5
"Location was amazing. But the staff was not helpful and unresponsive. We had to call 7x to try to get a response and then when we went in person, they were incredibly rude.",4
"It was a great stay, even though relative to the crazy prices in this city it was a lower price - the standard was high, the location great and all over a positive experience. The showers were amazing!",5
Perfect location within a short walk to many attractions or the subway. Quiet location except for noisy neighbors. Not the most updated but for the price and location it was not a bad place.,3
"This is a great location in NYC to get everywhere! I love to walk and midtown is always my favorite place to be to head to Central Park, museums and theater. The Shoreham is a great spot. Super easy and friendly staff. Thanks for a great stay!",5
"Great location, good staff, tired rooms, but clean. For the price and location, we can overlook stained carpets and surfaces. The bed and bathroom were clean. There is a nice pub frequented by locals and the after work crowd called Cassidy's. Good for a drink or quick meal.",4
"The Shoreham was a great place to stay for our first trip to Midtown Manhattan. Very walkable to Central Park, Rockefeller Center, Times Square, Broadway theaters, 5th Ave show, museums, restaurants, etc. Price was reasonable in comparison to other hotels. Our room was small but very clean and the bed and pillows were comfortable. We were able to check in early but they will also store your luggage before and after check-in/check-out. My only suggestion is to charging ports for electronic devices.",5
"This hotel was decent for the price, and the location was solid and super close to everything you want to be near. The room was fairly nice, but lacked common features like a microwave, fridge, and night stands on both sides of the bed. The bathroom was far smaller than it appeared, and there was really only room to stand at the sink (which was the size of an airplane sink.) The shower was pretty nice, but the hot water only lasted for about 4 mins and then turned cold (great water pressure tho!) The TV (streaming and cable) along with wifi didn’t work, so had to rely on hotspot which wasn’t a super big deal but would have been nice to have some WiFi. Other than that, this place was a solid place to get some good sleep after exploring the city.",4
"Pros: Excellent location, fantastic walkability to subway stations and midtown attractions. Quiet room which was great! Staff were really friendly (always greeted us and tried to help us with any needs). Daily cleaning service which was lovely. Downstairs had a mini kiosk with coffee/beverages and snacks and an adjacent fine dining restaurant! Cons: Lots o’ stains (carpet, curtains, cloth portions of wall). Needs an overhaul. Found a make-up stain and stray black hair (definitely not ours) on one of our bath towels. Cigarette smell on our floor but not in the room itself. Window did not seal fully but curtain at least helped keep the cold out. Phone didn’t work despite maintenance coming to work on it (though speakerphone did work!). No ice bucket and then when I asked for one it was dirty :/ To sum it up — some cleanliness/maintenance issues… BUT overall we loved the location and convenience and we were happy with our stay and how we were treated by the staff :)",3
"Great hotel in an unbeatable location—right in the center of everything. The subway is only a block away, making it an ideal spot for visiting NYC.",5
Perfect location allowed for easy access to the cities best sites. Very kind staff and welcoming space contributed to a nice visit. I would choose to stay here again,5
"Location, location, location! If you’re looking for the best location is this one. No doubts. The hotel in general needs maintenance, the rooms look outdated like the lights don’t turn off when you out, the doors doesn’t looks pretty secure, and the elevator is old but at the end you can rest pretty fair after walking around NYC the whole day. The bathroom is nice, I went alone, so you might have to consider there’s only one sink but is pretty cool for one. It called my attention the gym didn’t have treadmill. The personal is nice in general. I only received complimentary water when I checked in and I asked the next day and said “they don’t have it”. They didn’t have bathrobes available, I mean in the middle of winter when you’re freezing after taking a bath, it would be nice. I would suggest they can give you some maps or suggestions if you’re coming for tourism of the first time. At the end, it could be better but is fair for the price. Location is everything.",4
Great location and value! Showing its age a little but stay was much better than expected for the money. Will stay again.,5
"Nothing fancy, very roomy centrally located. Which was convenient for where we were looking to stay !!",4
We would definitely stay here again. The location was great.,5
"Great location, fair pricing, room was fine - only issue was water pressure.",4
"Great location. Great price. For this party of town and price, very spacious rooms.",5
Great location. Small elevator and very small bathroom but it was fine for two nights.,4
The location was convenient and the host was great. Very responsive and helpful.,5
"If you’re planning to book here, MAKE SURE YOU READ THE LISTING! I booked a 1 king bed, which looked spacious in the photos. Once we checked in, the room seemed SO much smaller. I realized even the bed was much smaller, like a full size bed. There was hardly any room to put our luggage. You basically had to walk around the bed because the room was so small. Something didn’t seem right, so I re-read the listing. Only when I complained, did they look to see if there were other king bed rooms. Then they told me they didn’t have any more king beds! So why do you overbook?! I asked for a partial refund since I wasn’t getting what I signed up for. Thankfully, the staff were kind and upgraded us to a suite room. While I am very grateful for the customer service, I do feel annoyed that they initially thought they could pull a bait and switch on us. My friend is the type of person who wouldn’t complain, and that would be incredibly unfair to those who put up with it but still pay for it.",3
They don’t provide water which is annoying and the blankets are scratchy and uncomfortable. The check in receptionist was rude.,3
Everyone we encountered was very helpful and friendly. Would recommend to others. Plan to stay again :),5
"Great spot - very central to everything you need to get to, and walking (or running) distance to Central Park!",5
"the location was super convenient for sure. i found their front desk employee Flor to be incredibly helpful when i was checking in and wanted to switch rooms, as the original room smelled heavily of mold. she got me into a new room right away. there was no clear disclosure about having to pay an additional fee for wi-fi . i was traveling with my service dog and ultimately needed to pay an additional daily fee to keep a mini fridge in my room, whose cost was also not advertised, but that’s okay as well. my biggest note / feedback is that generally the hotel front desk staff has clearly not been trained by their superiors to be solution oriented. one small and silly example is that i asked for a plastic fork and spoon my last night there to eat food in my room and the gentlemen on duty refused to give me one, even though it was quite clear they were resourced to do so. other than that, i generally found the front desk staff to be friendly but generally not super accommodating",4
"Overall The Shoreham is a fantastic deal for the price. Room is comfy, larger than your average NY hotel room, with an amazing location near Madison Avenues, Times Square and Central Park. Great location for new tourists. The only downside is that the room smelled like cigarette smoke and the bed sheets had what seems to be a blood stain. I spoke to the cleaning personnel and they switched them with clean ones, but I had to wait until the following day because I arrive late and there was no one available; plus, you expect your bed to be clean when you arrive after hours of traveling.",4
Thank you to the team and white & olive and the kiosk. And all who help to make this grt and affordable. KA,5
"Location is great, nesr the central park and the check-in and check-out went smoothly",5
"Great location, the baggage storage service was very helpful, and room was clean.",5
Will definitely make it our default choice for our manhattan future stays. Very convenient and clean,5
"Centrally located, friendly staff!",5
"Great hotel, great neighborhood, highly recommend",5
Best location for the price in Midtown.,5
Excellent location extremely convenient.,5
perfect walkable location,5
Really expensive and did not feel like a hotel.,3
"Clean, nice enough room. Prime location, low price.",5
All was generally good. Could use new carpet in the room. Great location. Bigger than expected.,4
Great location & clean!,5
Great place to stay,5
"Great location, convenient to everything in downtown NYC!",5
Nice place to stay if you’re in Manhattan.,5
Very clean and great location,5
"Clean and tidy , Don’t accept cash as deposit",4
The Shoreham was well located,5
Good,5
Thanks for a great stay!,4
"The location is unbeatable, close to everything, you can easily get there from JFK by train without the need for taxis. It's very close to everything. The reception is open 24 hours and the cleaning staff is very friendly. The only thing was that there was no water dispenser Translated from Spanish Show original",5
Great spot for the location,5
it was nice! I would come back!,4
Great stay. Great location,5
"An excellent lodging option, close to strategic points to get to know New York safely Translated from Spanish Show original",5
great location and nice staff,5
everything as indicated on the AIRBNB app. Great choice. Translated from Italian Show original,5
"8 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · December 2025 A comfortable stay in a basic one bedroom apartment with all amenities. Very clean and comfortable. Awesome communication from the host with very clear instructions. I would recommend if you didn’t want to pay the earth in Manhattan. Just be prepared to travel to the key tourist destinations.",5
"Very nice and extremely clean place in a good area. It was fun to walk around the neighborhood, and the location is convenient to NYC. There are also plenty of excellent restaurants nearby.",5
Sal was an amazing host. He allowed us to check in early since our plane landed at 1pm. He was very accommodating. He also recommended a wonderful restaurant that was across the street. The best burger we’ve ever had. The bakery next door is phenomenal also. I would definitely stay again.,5
"Unfortunately I had to leave Sal’s place in a hurry due to a medical emergency. However, my time spent there was absolutely amazing! This place is literally like having my home on the road with me. It’s beautiful, clean, and cozy. I will absolutely stay here again.",5
"Sal's unit exceeded my expectations. Everything was really neat and super clean. I love how it also included a washer and dryer with tide pods to do laundry. The ice machine worked, there were plenty of linens, and it was extremely spacious. I would definitely stay here again when I come back to NYC!",5
"Thank you Sal and Elizabeth, the place was amazing beyond words. Very homey feeling and comfortable I did NOT want to check out. Thank you so much for the loving and warm hospitality. Do plan to book again in the near future, thanks again for everything.",5
"sal is a mensch! He’s not only funny but helpful very quick to respond and is very concerned and attentive to his guests if you’re visiting in the city, it will be harder to do better than staying with Sal spend the night at his place. You won't regret it!",5
"★★★★★ Sal was a fantastic host from start to finish. Communication was easy and responsive throughout our stay, which made everything seamless. The apartment was lovely, spotlessly clean, and very well located in New Jersey, with excellent transport links into New York City. The bus into Manhattan and the Port Authority was easy to access, and the riverway ferry was a great option too. The apartment had everything we needed for a comfortable stay, and the pull-out bed was good quality and very comfortable. We really enjoyed our stay and wouldn’t hesitate to stay here again when visiting New York City. Highly recommended.",5
"Such a beautiful place! Friends and I stayed here for a concert nearby, immediately noticed the lovely neighborhood, and we felt super safe. Apartment was super clean, and the host gave super clear instructions along the way. Would definitely stay again!",5
A remarkable place with remarkable hosts. It was clean and very comfortable. Elizabeth and Sal answered every question quick and were very friendly. Getting into Manhattan was really easy by bus in just 30 min. Places like this make your vacations really easy. Thank you!,5
"Very clean and completely updated in all areas of the apartment. Would be great for a week stay if you didn’t need daily access to your car. Parking is not included, which we knew before going. I parked down at port imperial and walked or took an uber from garage. The price, cleanliness and location still made it worth the walk. We were you going into the city each day but ate breakfast at Dulce de Leche (down the street) then took the bus into the city.",5
"9 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · October 2025 Lovely quiet neighborhood. Easy convenient bus to go to New York Midtown. A supermarket right downstairs or a 7-Eleven further down. Clean apartment with state of the art appliances. Just very thin ceiling floor, you could easily hear upstairs people walking around.",5
"Amazing host! Clear instructions, quick to respond, and very helpful. The place was clean, spacious, and just as described. We had a great stay and would love to come back. Thank you 🙏",5
"First I wanna thank Sal and his spouse for being so kind and helpful with every question we had. My family and I totally loved this place! We would totally 100% come here again, very beautiful and peaceful neighborhood! The bus is down the block which we used our credit card to pay the times we visited Manhattan. There is several grocery stores around but my favorite was Jersey Market fruits and vegetables nice and humble people. Parker Cafe right across the street is a cozy place to eat and to get coffee. There is also two nice little bars down the street which is very awesome to see, it's like something out of a movie in this neighborhood! Overall beautiful place to stay at. Also the bus from this Airbnb home to the bus terminal (port authority) in Manhattan is about 20 minute ride and charges 4 bucks per person. Very easy to use after using couple times.",5
it was super nice staying here! they definitely think about their guests. pots and pans if you want to cook…it was really nice,5
Great stay! We had a quick stay but it was worth it! Very comfortable and clean. No issues whatsoever. I’d definitely recommend sals place.,5
"Sal was an excellent host and helped me accommodate my niece, who was visiting us for a few days. My niece loved the place.",5
"The apartment was excellent, and the neighborhood was quiet. The bus stop is just a few minutes down the street, and it takes about 15 minutes to get to Port Authority. Although we didn’t spend much time in the accommodation during the day, it was well equipped and everything was clean. I would especially highlight the bed linen and towels, which smelled wonderfully fresh. There’s a store and a few small fast-food places on the street, and we met quite a few locals—one man even showed us the building entrance when we first arrived. We stayed for 5 nights, and I highly recommend this accommodation.",5
"I stayed in Sals place for 7 days and it was very nice. The area was nice and there’s many different shops near by such as Colombian restaurant, Chinese restaurant, Pharmacy, hardware store, ECT. The place was clean and exactly how it looks in the pictures and it's close to the city. Sal was kind and responds very fast, i really reccomend this place.",5
We loved our stay at Sal’s. It’s 30 mins from the city by bus and the bus stop is only a block away. We got a great view of the city skyline. The place was super spotless and spacious. The bed was incredibly comfortable. We had three guests and the place never felt small. We were able to check in early. Would definitely stay here again.,5
"Sal's place was absolutely wonderful! The location was perfect, especially since it was so close to the bus station, making it easy to get into NYC. The apartment itself was clean, comfortable, and stylish. Sal was also a fantastic host, providing us with great information and being very responsive to our questions. We would definitely stay here again!",5
"We had a great time staying in Sal’s apartment. It was clean, comfortable and exactly what we needed. It was located near the bus stop which made it so easy to get around and into the city. There were plenty of fresh towels, and lots of coffee, which was really appreciated. Overall it was a great apartment and perfect spot for us to explore",5
A hidden gem!!! Perfect space to chill and super super clean!!! The pictures fit the apartment very well!,5
Great location for a quick mini-vacation to the city. Sal was very responsive.,5
This is the third time we have stayed here. We love it! Even though it's on the Jersey side you walk out the door and the bus is literally like 30 seconds or so from the door. super easy. There are some great restaurants in walking distance as well. We hope to stay in the not too distant future! Thanks again for a wonderful stay!,5
"We had a wonderful time and the space was very nice! All 4 rooms were taken but we never had to wait for the bathroom. We also didn’t hear the other guests at all. The view was beautiful and for the price we paid, this was an amazing accommodation for us. We would love to come back!",5
The view is absolutely fabulous and as described very easy to get to the Port Athority station with regular buses. Wilder was readily available for questions if needed. It is a wonderful shared space in a quiet area of NJ.,4
"The location and the view of New York City were truly spectacular. Public transportation was very close and easy to access. At first, we had some trouble with the hot water, but the night before we left, we managed to get it working. I must say, the host was always attentive and even replied to messages late at night. Without a doubt, I would stay here again.",5
"Five stars all around, truly. For a place with a shared bathroom and public spaces this was exceptional. All rooms I interacted with were spotless. Wilder was highly responsive, other guests were polite, it felt quiet and private. It was also close enough to uptown NYC that if I needed to come back, I would probably find it convenient to stay here again.",5
"We had an amazing stay here! The place was spotless. Sheets were clean, blankets were clean. Clean towels, shower and bathroom were spotless. We had needed extra towels he answered within 20 minutes and delivered them same day! He’s very quick to respond when I would message him. Bus stop is not even a 5 minute walk down the street about 20 minute ride to NYC. Beautiful skyline view from the home. This is a shared place with other people! But it was not bad at all and we had no problems. It will be cold when you first get in your room! But once you turn on the heat in your room it’s perfect. Overall and amazing experience and we will be coming again!! Thank you Wilder!",5
"Excellent and would definitely come back here. Loved the house, didn't know it was shared though, but didn't really matter. Hos was very helpful and lovely house 🏠 with the best views ❤️ just like the pictures.",5
"I took a weekend trip to New York and stayed at Wilder's house. Overall, it was a great experience. There was self-check-in, a nice, clean room, and a friendly host who answered quickly. I highly recommend it!",5
"The place was nice and clean! Room was spacious and as described. The apartment is shared between 4 rooms with one shared bathroom. Not much to do in the area but the bus to Manhattan was just around the corner and took 20 min to Port Authority, easy access. Overall a good place to stay near Manhattan :)",4
"It’s a cozy and very convenient accommodation! 3 mins away from bus station and $4 to take you to manhattan midtown. It’s about 15-20mins away from mid town, depending on traffic. Very nice city skyline at night! Owner responds very proactively and it’s a quiet environment at night. I would recommend to anyone looking for a short stay in NYC!",5
"Excellent stay here. House in quiet and safe area. Clean room, kitchen and bathroom. 4 rooms sharing one bathroom was little annoying after a long day. (There is another separate toilet btw). Close to bus stop which connects to Manhattan very easily. Remember NJ transit is different from MTA. Traffic could be very bad in the morning (before10am) and around 4-6pm so be aware.",5
"I am very satisfied with my stay here. The place is beautiful with a gorgeous view of the skyline. I had a bit of trouble with the check in instructions at first, but Wilder was very quick to respond and help guide me in the correct direction. The airbnb was very clean and spacious. I would definitely return in the future!",5
"Had a great stay here. The place was exactly as described, very clean and comfortable. The views of the NYC skyline were amazing, and the location was spot on. It’s a quiet area, which made it feel safe and relaxing. Getting into the city was easy too; the bus runs frequently and it’s only $4 each way. I wouldn’t hesitate to come back. Highly recommend.",5
everything is perfect about the place clean close to Manhattan safe and has a beautiful view,5
second time we have stayed here and just love it. The view from the porch is amazing of the skyline! Hopefully can stay again!,5
The view of the city is 100% the standout of the accommodation. It’s very easy and cheap to get to Times Square.,5
"As everyone already said, this place is super clean with amazing view. The 24 hour bus to downtown Manhattan is very convenient. The neighborhood feels safe as well. I would totally come back.",4
We had a great time and so glad we found this place. We were on foot and the bus is right there. Just be sure to have one dollar bills. If the tap machine isn't working they will not let ya off the hook. 4 Dollars a ride. Anyway we loved staying here and plan on returning! Great view!,5
"the room was very nice and clean, I liked decoration, the place was peaceful to rest, we felt very comfortable there, Wilder responded quickly any question, I definitely recommend this place.",5
"9 years on Airbnb Rating, 4 stars , · November 2025 Place was clean and near to NY and accessible throughout",4
Amazing place to stay around New York. Very close to public transportation access.,5
"Good place to stay, was very clean, it looked just like the photo, 100% recommended!",5
"The listing was as described. It is very well located, in just 20 minutes we were in Manhattan. The bus station is 3 minutes away and you can take 3 different ones to go to the center. The neighborhood is very quiet, residential and peaceful. Nothing to say about the accommodation itself and its cleanliness. Everything was perfect, I would recommend! Translated from French Show original",5
"Very good, cheap considering for the majestic views outside, no downsides.",5
"It was a great place and I enjoyed my stay very much! I’d love to come back again for future trips. It was a great spot, not too far from the subway. And great views if you walk a few blocks toward manhattan.",5
"I had a great stay in Astoria! The area was really nice and felt safe, with lots of places nearby and the subway just a short walk away. Check-in was super easy, the apartment was clean and comfortable, and David and Mila were really kind and welcoming hosts. Perfect spot for my short stay in Queens!",5
"Its safe, comfortable and clean. Don't expect much. Its a good place to come back at night to and crash at but thats all—nothing more. Couple of nice restaurants around and its around 45 mins from Manhattan by the subway.",5
"For the price, the place could seriously use some updating. The front hall way, and bathroom are in rough shape. The Bedroom was the only space truly taken care of well.",4
They were always quick to respond and also let me leave my cases due to a late flight and come pick them up. a great budgeted apartment with your own large room,5
"Nice place, quiet neighborhood, cost effective place to stay in NYC, very easy and quick to get to midtown Manhattan. Thank you!",5
Quiet and clean. Great location close to subway and other public transportation. Very easy to get to from LGA airport. Walkable to everything you need,5
"Our stay at David and Mila's place was the New York experience we hoped for! David provided thorough instructions and photos on how to reach the BNB which was very helpful. The quiet suburban neighborhood felt right at home and was walking distance to many great restaurants and markets. So long as you get the maps right, getting to and from Manhattan takes about 25-30 minutes. The kitchen had all basic amenities. We brewed some hot tea and hot chocolate on our last day and enjoyed the final sips of our trip out on the balcony. Would recommend David and Mila's BNB for those looking for an undisturbed quiet getaway that is still close distance to many attractions. Great stay!",5
"This stay is for people who want the bare minimum and a place to rest their head for their stay in NYC. I only stayed for two nights and was out for most of those days. The comment that mentioned a “domestic incident” downstairs I will say those tenants were arguing loudly when I arrived around midnight but I couldn’t hear them once I closed my door however you can hear people come and go from the shared bathroom on the second floor. While I do feel the pictures feel a bit different than what I walked into, the stay was clean and clear of clutter and good for my short visit and what I needed to do in the city.",4
The listing came in clutch at the last moment. Got considerably cheaper than any other places inside NYC. Overall good night stay.,5
"Distancia to subway was perfect, nice neighborhood and everything you may need near!",5
"This was worth the price. It was a little confusing coming into the building, we weren’t sure where the kitchen was and that was where we were supposed to put our bags. It was behind the door labeled 2,3. It was very clean, the bed linens smelled like clean laundry and the bathroom was attended to daily. There are 3 bedrooms on the upper floor that share the kitchen and the bathroom. This room was outside of the main apartment and was just alone right off of the stairs. The Astoria neighborhood was a great place to stay because it has so many restaurants walking distance and it’s away from the hustle of Manhattan. We didn’t spend much time in the room, it was mostly just a place to sleep and shower and it fit our needs. It is also a convenient walk to the train which made commuting so easy.",4
Appreciated the accommodation. I only stayed for one night. The room was clean and the host were very responsive.,5
We appreciated an affordable stay in such a fantastic location. Check in was easy and the room was exactly like the photos. David and Mila were responsive hosts and we would definitely stay here again.,5
"It was a great experience because even if you are visiting NY only for a few days, they give you all the facilities. I really appreciate the great communication. In one text, they explain everything what I needed to know.",5
"Great, quiet place to stay. Super clean, love having a private room and having a place for my food to be stored in the fridge. David and Mila are friendly and gave helpful, clear instructions to their Airbnb. Will definitely come back :)",5
"This place was super convenient and Astoria is lovely. As a previous Astoria resident, this place is great- because it’s quiet and close to trains and a great location. I traveled alone and the space was great for me to work remote and also having the landing pad I needed. Super comfy bed, nice strong shower, and access to full kitchen. David was very responsive and helpful I was able to leave my luggage and everything felt safe! I will be back!",5
Short walk away from subway station.,4
Close to train station. Astoria is very quiet and peaceful neighborhood at night. NYC is only 30 min from this place. I slept well at this place!,5
I wanted to extend but it is so perfect that they are all booked out! Book in advance so you can stay longer!!,5
"David was a very responsive host who provided me with enough detail to know where to go and what I needed to do in order to get in. I recommend their place as a convenient location to rest your head before heading to nearby Manhattan but I wouldn’t stay here if you are looking for peace and tranquility as there was a literal domestic incident going on in the apartment below me that was extremely loud and concerning. Could have been a one time thing and really not much the hosts could have done as they weren’t staying in the apartment with me, but just something to keep in mind when comparing listings.",4
Cozy and quiet stay in Queens! Thank you again!,5
"A nice, clean place in a pleasant Queens neighborhood. Lots to do around. Near the train to Manhattan.",5
The pictures of the room and bathroom do not match the Airbnb. Very disappointing and deceptive considering the price.,2
"5 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · January 2026 This apartment was clean and super easy to find and get to front JFK airport. The 6 Subway was a ~9min walk while the Q subway was ~12mins, so access to public transport was easy. Only a few blocks from Central Park and only a 25-30min subway ride to the lower end of Manhattan. Aleksandr also responded very promptly and was very nice. We met Carla at the apartment and she was very nice. Even though it was a shared bathroom it was kept tidy and even cleaned while we were there. Thank you for letting us stay :)",5
"great place for a place to stay for a quick trip to nyc. it was close to bus and subway and has lots of shops, restaurants and activities right outside. area felt plenty safe. room had everything i needed. it was great and everything i needed for visiting a friend for a day in the city!",5
"Alex and his wife were super accommodating and very communicative. They made my short visit very comfortable and stress free. They truly are great hosts and their place was so cute and cozy. As someone who considers themselves a light sleeper, I would not say it was particularly loud by any means. If you stay here I think you will really enjoy your stay.",5
"Aleksandr, Carla and Tati were friendly. They are very accommodating and respectful. I highly recommend the place to stay if you visit NYC. Train and subways are accessible. The place is safe. Some resto and shops are near in the area. Thank you for your wonderful place and service! Keep it up!",5
"Aleksandr was a very nice host and had a beautiful place! Everything was very neat and organized, felt bigger in person compared to the pictures ! He included a whole shelf in the room for me and my friend that had face masks, toothbrushes, sunscreen, pretty much all of the toiletries we needed in case we forgot to pack it! I had a relatively short stay so we did not spend much time there other than to sleep but if I ever do plan to book in the city again I will definitely see if this listing is available. 10/10 would recommend, thank you 🫶",5
"Thanks Alex for hosting! I just booked one day before my stay and he was so responsive. Located near Central Park in Manhattan, the room was cozy and reasonably priced. Clean and tidy apartment with all amenities I needed. Around 10 mins walk from 2 metro lines. Peaceful neighbourhood though you might sometimes hear the street given the proximity. Alex and the co-hosts were welcoming and tried to cater my requests. They shared breakfast and desserts with me. Alex from time to time checked in with me to make sure I was okay, and gave me travel suggestions. I was nice talking to him. The stay in Alex's place made my trip in New York even better. Highly recommended!",5
"We had an enjoyable stay in NYC and the location of the flat is great, close to Central Park, public transport and other amenities. The room is like in the picture and the hosts, Aleksandr and Tatiany are really nice people and super friendly and welcoming; they made everything to make us feel at home during our stay. This really made a difference.",5
"Aleksandr was prompt, professional and polite from the start. We were pleasantly surprised to find that the home was even more welcoming than we could have imagined. The guest amenities were a very nice add-on. Moreover, the hosts were exceptionally welcoming (their exceptional culinary skills were on display, when we arrived, and continued to impress! Yet, they left space for us to happliy enjoy our light meal in the common area. They took an interest in how they could assist with our plans to be in New York for our <24-hr. whirlwind visit. It was exceptionally helpful to have guidance about parking in the locale, although we were lucky enough to find a spot on the street. We felt very secure and safe at Aleksandr's AirBnB, and very much like the idea of visiting again soon.",5
"Alex's flat is close to subway, clean and with balcony. Alex and his girlfired are friendly and always keen to help. I highly recommend it",4
"Wonderful little home stashed away in the heart of the Apple. Had an absolute blast staying here, with both hosts being both welcoming and supportive. Will be definitely coming back!",5
"Your best bet to explore NY. We happened to spend a long weekend and found Alex’s place just perfect. Its location is amazing, within walking distance to Central Park, many restaurants and supermarkets, and close to the public transport. The room and bed were comfy, and the flat super well equipped which allowed us to cook breakfast and meals. The host was most gracious, instructions were always clear and allowed us to store our bags so we could take advantage of our time in the city. 100% recommended!",5
"Alex was super friendly and very responsive to all of our messages. The first night, he stayed up and made sure to wait for me and my girlfriend to get inside, even though we both had late arrivals. He gave some recommendations and was very accommodating. The room is definitely cozy and we both fit snugly, although we weren't in the apartment much because we were nearby the Metro and more. If you are looking for an affordable place to stay with a friendly host, this is the place to go!",5
I enjoyed staying at this place. The room was nice and cozy. The location was very convenient and walkable. Alex and his family were very great host!,5
"Excellent accommodation for visiting New York, close to Central Park, the subway will take you quickly to the center of New York. The room is comfortable and overlooks the street. Aleksander was a great host, responds very quickly and is very understanding. A great stay Translated from French Show original",5
"The place is very good, everything is clean and tidy every day, the hosts are very friendly and helpful, Alex always answered our questions immediately. I highly recommend this place and the area is very good. Translated from Spanish Show original",5
Alek’s place was clean and comfortable! Would definitely recommend it.,5
Our stay went very well! Aleksandr was a responsive and welcoming host and the accommodation matched the photos well. The atmosphere was friendly and we were well placed to visit the city. The room was great. Translated from French Show original,4
"We had a great week and a half stay at Aleksandr’s place! The place is comfortable and well-equipped. And what's most important is that it is close to numerous Manhattan landmarks and attractions. Thank you Aleksandr for taking good care of us, for your recommendations and responsiveness! We absolutely recommend Aleksandr's place as a great spot for both shorter and longer stays!",5
"It was extremely pleasant to stay in Aleksandr's apartment, in addition to all the support, his hospitality and his wife were extremely special and helped me a lot! Thank you and I would definitely stay again! Translated from Portuguese Show original",5
"The place was really nice and perfectly suited for two people. ☺️We felt comfortable as soon as we arrived. The hosting was really great: our hosts were able to leave us all the necessary peace while remaining available if needed.😌 I really appreciated their attentiveness, such as hygiene products and even feminine products, which shows how much they think about the comfort of their guests. It's a delicacy that really pleases and makes the stay even more enjoyable. A great experience in New York that I would recommend without hesitation! 😃 Translated from French Show original",5
It was a pleasant journey in NYC. Thanks for the hosting.,5
"I had a nice stay. The room is small, but ideal for resting after a day of exploring. The bed was comfortable, I felt right at home from the first night. Alex is always attentive, aware of every detail without being invasive, with a warmth that is appreciated, his kindness made everything flow with ease. Would definitely recommend Translated from Spanish Show original",5
It was a nice place to stay during our trip to NYC.,5
Enjoyed my stay. Great value for money.,5
"Tony is such a great person and Host, he was so helpful and explained everything to us. easy check in very safe too and the room was perfect. it was a little far (12minutes) from the subway if you are not used to walking but that's just me. after a few days I got used to it. also everything was clean.",5
Tony was absolutely amazing and was very flexible regardless of the situation. The place was absolutely gorgeous with beautiful decorations and trinkets. I highly recommend staying here if you are visiting.,5
"11 months on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · December 2025 Tony was really helpful and responsive with anything we needed. It was only a 12 minute walk to the Subway and there was plenty of cafes and restaurants close by. Thank you so much Tony!",5
"my experience staying at Tony's place was fantastic from start to finish. Tony was always available via text to give clear instructions on how to enter the property and to enter the secure bedroom. the location was perfect as it was only a short walk to the metro to get access to the city center. the bedroom was clean and tidy, the heating definitely worked (sometimes a little to well). I would recommend this location to anyone wanting to visit NYC for business or for pleasure. thanks Tony for a great stay.",5
"We loved our stay at Tony’s place! The room & office are so comfortable and inviting after a long day exploring in NYC and Tony was very welcoming. The neighborhood is quiet, peaceful and easy to get to from the subway. Everyday we looked forward to returning to the house to enjoy the space. Wifi was great for work, the kitchen was clean with everything you’ll need and the shower was hot & with great water pressure. Thank you, Tony, for such a memorable stay!",5
"Tony is a good guy. Very helpful. Everything was as described in the ad. The bed was comfortable, the toilet was clean . Kitchen easy to use. Front yard perfect for chilling. Good connection to the bus and train. Thank you for hosting me. recommend 100%",5
"Tony is a fantastic host. The room is large and very well equiped in the minimun details. Excelent kitchen, well equiped, rules well define and enough to the shared kitchen and bathroom. Really felt at home. Thanks Tony.",5
"Thank you, Tony! You’re kind & friendly. We really loved our small talk and your help with the luggages. We also loved the room so much, it felt like home, it’s so spacious, clean & beautiful. If we go back to NYC again, we will book with your place again. 😊",5
One of the nicest rooms ever !! Very clean property. Really calm also. Both hosts were so kind !! I will definitely book again!,5
Love the bright sunny space facing the street - generous space and thoughtful amenities upon arrival. Tony was responsive and would come back for another stay.,5
"My husband and I had the pleasure of staying in this wonderful apartment for 10 days during our honeymoon – and it was absolutely perfect! The place was spotlessly clean and incredibly quiet. Both the room and the kitchen were very well equipped – everything we needed was there. The host Tony was not only incredibly welcoming and kind, but also had a great sense of humor, which made our stay even more enjoyable. We truly got to relax and enjoy every moment. The city is magical, and from the very beginning, we felt right at home. A huge thank to Tony – we would love to come back and highly recommend this place to anyone!",5
Tony was an excellent host very helpful in showing the air bnb and all it has to offer he made me feel at home right away and the room itself has everything you need and is very nicely decorated and it only takes around 30 minutes to get to midtown manhattan next time I stay in New York City I will definitely stay there if available!!! Thanks Tony!!!,5
"Tony is a great host! Very friendly, helpful and kind. He made sure we had everything we need and we felt very much at home. The whole accommodation is furnished and decorated with a lot of love. Everything is as described and we loved our stay there. Also the conmunication with Tony was excellent. Very happy we found this treasure!",5
Had a fantastic experience! Thank you for the lovely stay. Beautifully decorated and just what I needed for my short 24 hours in NYC,5
"Tony was a brilliant and attentive host. The place is nicely located in a quiet part of Queens, with straightforward access into Manhattan. Highly recommend!",5
"beautiful private room, we got everything we needed like towels, blankets, netflix, fridge, coffee, water heater, AC and more inside the room. the apartment is nice, got everything you need for living and there are 2 more rooms with guests/renter, which are all sharing one bathroom. it is a 10 min walk to the next subway Station which brings you to Manhattan within 15/20 min, very good. (there is No elevator at this subway Station, in case someone needs it.) the neighboorhood is safe (we were two women) & beautiful, supermarkets, restaurants, small Shops like Delis are close by, comparatively cheap to manhattan and super for breakfast or dinner. Tony was helpful and reachable all the time, he also offered to pick us up by car at the metro station since there was heavy rain. we would book again :)",5
"Awesome stay!! Tony is a super responsive, kind, and thorough host. He has so many well thought out amenities to make your stay as comfortable as possible. And the room has its own AC so you can control the temp! Would definitely stay here again",5
"Tony is quite probably the best host I’ve ever encountered on Airbnb. He is friendly, proactive and well organized. The room was great, too. I would definitely recommend and would stay here again.",5
"2 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · June 2025 This place is amazing! CAN’T BE BETTER You can go to the centralpark, Times Square within 20 minutes by subway, no need to transfer hehe Above all else, Tony was super kind to us!! Good location, awesome host, nice place what can I say more?! 👍",5
"Amazing place to stay, Tony was very attentive and helpful with all our requests. The room wS beautiful and so comfortable. Very easy walk to station and bus stops. Would come again",5
"Tony is a very helpful and nice host. Apartment is very pleasant, tidy, comfortable, calm and well thought through in terms of hosting people. The bed is perfectly comfortable. Shared kitchen and bathroom. Both are well equipped. Metro is 10 minutes away and takes you to midtown Manhattan in 15-20 minutes. There is a lot of good grocery stores and local restaurants in the neighborhood. Perfect place to stay in New York. Thank you very much Tony.",5
"Tony’s place went above and beyond what we expected. Very friendly and pleasant host and always available. His place was just as described. We felt right at home. He had all the accommodations needed for 3 day stay. We felt safe walking the neighborhood even around 9 pm. The subway was around a 10 to 15 minute walking distance on that same road, no need to divert to another road. The photo on google does not do the front entrance justice as Tony has had the entrance remodeled. This is a place we absolutely recommended. Look forward to booking again in the future.",5
"Tony was a great host! Made it super easy to find the location, was very proactive in his communication, and did a great job of making the shared space feel very private. Will definitely be considering staying here again the next time I’m in the city.",5
"Tony's place is really lovely, I felt completely at home and incredibly safe in a lovely neighbourhood. It was really easy to get into Manhattan, there are plenty of stores and takeaways nearby and Tony was responsive, helpful and very friendly! I wouldn't hesitate to stay again. I have to say to that the media is currently very off putting about visiting the USA, but I had no issues at passport control and my whole trip was fantastic, with incredibly friendly New Yorkers being a highlight! Thanks Tony!",5
"You never know quite what to expect when you’re staying in a room in someone’s home. In Anastasia apartment, I felt like a welcome guest and was given the space and privacy I needed to get my work done during the day so I could enjoy the theater in the evenings. The apartment is exactly as described. It is small and cozy, has all the amenities that you need, and was much better than staying in hotel room.",5
"Anastasia is a responsive host. Her place is safe and good value. The flat is very clean, 5 min walk to the nearest subway. The neighborhood is very quiet. The appartement has two bedrooms the rental and hers. She wasn't there during my stay and her boyfriend kept the door closed so we didn't meet. No noise, no fuss, good if you're traveling on a budget. The only thing to be mindful of is the apartment is on the 4th floor after a steep and narrow staircase. Don't overpack 😉 Overall convenient & safe on a budget. 🙂",4
"The place is excellent as a launching point to the city. Even though the subway is a couple of blocks away it is rather easy to get around. Hot water takes some time to come out, but everything else was cozy and nice. I didn’t mind the stairs to the fourth floor but if you have big luggage it might be a challenge on the narrow staircase. Great host. Highly recommend it.",5
Great location in the middle of the city. The room was clean and had a comfortable bed. I never met Anastasia but she was very responsive and friendly when we communicated through the app.,5
"First time in Manhattan, I arrived in the middle of a heat wave on a day which NYC hit 100F, for which the AC installed in the room was a life saver. I liked the personal flair of the room, and it was very clean and comfortable as well. It's a great place for the solo traveler, though I found the the stairs a bit trickier to navigate with my luggage than expected. The location is very convenient for exploring the various areas of Manhattan.",5
"Overall, I was very satisfied with my stay. The location was super central, and the check-in process was smooth. The apartment description was accurate, and I appreciated the clear disclaimers about the lack of a lift and the slightly lively atmosphere. Anastassia was very responsive and accommodating, especially thankful for her flexibility with my luggage storage needs. All in all, I would definitely recommend her apartment!",5
"I had a wonderful stay at this Airbnb! The location was perfect—close to public transportation. The room was clean, comfortable, and exactly as described in the listing. The host was very responsive and helpful, providing clear check-in instructions. Overall, I highly recommend this place for anyone visiting New York !!",5
Anastasia was a great host and very responsive. She let me check in a few hours early so I didn’t have to carry my suitcase around. Would stay again!,5
"I choose Anastasia’s accommodation as I only really needed a place to sleep and store my items during the day. The apartment was very clean and easy to find. It’s is on the 4th floor, which was not a problem, but you can anticipate a narrow stair way. The apartment itself was exactly as pictured. It is within walking distance of Korea Town which I was looking forward to and is one transfer away from the Path train if you are looking to spend a day in NJ. There are lots of restaurants in the area and markets if you want to buy anything to cook in the kitchen later. During my stay the host was away for personal reasons but remained in contact at all times and still made me feel very welcomed. She allowed me to check in early which I greatly appreciated so I didn’t have to carry my bags around till check in. Overall, I enjoyed my time and would stay here again.",5
Great location. A four-block walk from the Empire State Building. Lower and midtown easily accessible for walking.,5
"Good place to stay. Small but that's expected in NY. I will say, it gets very hot and the AC either wasn't installed or wasn't working while I was there. It wasn't a big problem for me, but I could imagine in July or August that would be a deal breaker for many.",4
"Located on 32nd Street in Midtown, it’s very convenient for visiting attractions, and luggage storage is available. The host communicated clearly and promptly. The room was clean and tidy. In a place like Manhattan where every inch of space is precious, finding such a character-filled place at this price is almost unimaginable. If there’s any room for improvement, it would be the sound insulation—city noise can still be heard at night, so noise-cancelling headphones are recommended for sleeping.",5
The place and the host were perfect for my visit to New York.,5
The location of this property was perfect to get to Broadway and other locations.,5
Great location. Clear instructions. Clean place. Great space!,5
"I got Anastasia's place the morning my NYC lodging option suddenly fell through. It's a great place in a great location - convenient! The kids at the playground don't get started until past 8 AM, so I was able to sleep well. You do have to carry your luggage up to the 4th floor, but other than that, she provided an umbrella, a shoe horn (!), and everything I needed. I loved that I was able to cook my breakfast, as I was eating out for all the other meals. She emptied the closet and drawers so I could organize my luggage. She was also kind enough to let me drop off my luggage early, so Anastasia made my first day in NYC easier. I highly recommend the place!",5
"Even though the check-in time was late at night, they handled it pleasantly. During the stay, my boyfriend Miguel was very friendly and accommodating, and it was a very pleasant stay. Translated from Japanese Show original",5
All fine! I can only recommend!,5
Very accommodating and friendly host!,5
Excellent location. Thanks for having me to stay!,5
My stay in this appartment was just great. Room was clean and location was perfect to explore NYC. I highly recommend this place.,5
"great place, super conveniently located, extremely kind host. Made my work trip to NYC easy, comfortable and stress free!",5
Anastasia is a great host. She made my stay in New York very easy. I didn’t find the place noisy at all. I really recommend her place.,5
It was a great stay at a terrific location in Manhattan! Would definitely recommend and come back!,5
Exactly what we were looking for. This was a perfect find. Located a five minute walk away from a bus stop that takes you directly to and from the city. The room was excellent and they were the best hosts. Very attentive and helpful. Fully recommend.,5
"Loved this place! If you want to avoid the high hotel costs in the city on your next NYC trip, this is the perfect stay. It’s only 20 minutes from Manhattan, and the bus ride offers amazing skyline views. The hosts were incredibly friendly too.",5
"We had a great stay at this Airbnb. The apartment was clean, exactly as shown in the pictures, and just as described. The area felt safe and was very easy for us to reach. Transportation to and from Manhattan was excellent — we were able to get there in about 25 minutes, which made moving around the city super convenient. The hosts provided clear instructions, and accessing the place was simple. We also appreciated the towels and essentials they offered, and the bed was very comfortable. If we ever have the chance to return to New York, we would definitely stay here again.",5
Everything is as described and I spent Christmas here. It’s really good price for what it offers!!,5
The place worked out great for us. super easy to get to the Big city! Easy walk to the bus. Our host was super nice! Would stay again.,5
A great location and comfortable room for the price! Used public transportation the whole time with no issue! Such kind hosts!,5
"8 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · June 2025 I had a very nice time at Zoya and Mike's in West New York. The apartment is only a short bus ride to the city, which makes it very convenient to visit NY while also staying in a quieter, residential area. Lots of Latin American communities around so great food options and good vibes! I highly recommend it!",5
"I enjoyed my stay at Mike and Zoya's. Although I was not able to figure out the bus routes during my short stay, there were several near the location. I was, however, able to figure out the ferry into Midtown. This simple transportation plan was only a short walk from Mike's place and it become my primary route into Manhattan during my stay.",5
"It was a peaceful place near of grocery stores, something good in surroundings. The place was completely clean, everything was fine. Thank you!",5
Lovely location and great host to work with. Very well supplied and just the space I needed.,4
"Wow, just WOW! 🌟 From the very first moment we arrived, we truly felt at home — actually, even better. The place is fresh, quiet, and absolutely incredible, perfect for resting and disconnecting. Everything is so well taken care of, you can really feel the love and dedication put into it. The host was super kind, attentive, and always ready to help, which made the experience even more special. Honestly, it felt like visiting a dear family member, but with all the comfort of a luxury stay. We slept wonderfully, rested completely, and every corner of the place gave us peace. 💫 Without a doubt, this is a place I would come back to a thousand times and recommend wholeheartedly to anyone looking for the perfect stay. Thank you for everything! 💖",5
"Inexpensive stay, and I was only a short walk to a bus that took me to a terminal for subway access to Manhattan. I was thrown off on my first morning because the pictured windows do not get sunlight, but it wasn't a big deal. Would definitely stay here again.",5
"I had a great stay, wonderful neighborhood with many great places to eat within walkable distance. very easy to get to and from manhattan in about 15-20 minutes on the bus. host was very friendly and helpful.",5
The place was great! A quick 15 minute bus ride from NYC. Was fairly easy to get around. They were both very responsive and friendly. I’d definitely book again next time I’m in the city!,5
"It was a great place at a perfect location and they provided essentials to make our stay amazing, thank you.",5
"excellent value for money for those visiting New York. Only 6 minutes from the bus stop that connects Manhattan, super comfortable and fast transportation. The environment was also very clean and comfortable, the hosts were also very helpful and friendly. I definitely recommend this accommodation, we were two women and we felt very safe! Thank you Translated from Portuguese Show original",5
"It was very smooth from check-in to check-out, and the host replied quickly to messages, so I was reassured. Two women stayed in one room, but it was fully equipped with amenities, the room was clean, and we had a very comfortable stay.The other room seemed to be rented by a couple, but it was very quiet, and if we met them, we would just exchange greetings. They also provided water and sweets, and it was a very pleasant trip. Thank you! Translated from Japanese Show original",5
"Great stay, thank you for hosting me",5
Absolutely amazing host. Place is perfect for what you need. They provided items I didn't even know I needed.. Cant eat to stay again..,5
"An amazing place to stay. Not only is it very comfortable, but it is also very close to the bus stop to go to New York. Zoya was always very attentive and available for anything. A great host and an excellent place. The only comment to note for those who book this place is that the room is right next to what I think is the engine room. So if you're a sound-sensitive person, it's something to consider. However, if you are not, the truth is that it does not bother or disturb you. Highly recommended. Translated from Spanish Show original",5
"Best option of Airbnb! Easy access, great location, great hosts and ammenities!",5
good people,5
"The location of the listing is ideal for those who want to reach Manhattan quickly (4 buses take you there and they pass every 5-10 min max - the 128, 165, 166 and 168 buses are $4.50). They take you directly to Port Authority (in Times Square). You can also take the ferry to get to NY ($10). The accommodation is in the basement but the room is very good. Translated from French Show original",5
"holiday inn was a good and comfortable place to stay. the rooms were spacious and clean, the restaurant not expensive with a interesting selection of food and the staff were helpful and friendly. boy did i enjoy & look forward to getting my daily bottles of water that kept me refreshed for the whole day ;)",5
"13 years on Airbnb Rating, 4 stars , · 2 weeks ago I had a pleasant stay at Holiday Inn New York City Wall Street. The location is excellent, right in the heart of the city. While the room size is on the smaller side, it offers good value for money given the prestigious location. Adding complimentary breakfast would make the experience even better. Overall, a comfortable and convenient stay.",4
"The doorman closed both of the sliding doors and we couldn’t get in with our key through the second door. Waited patiently, knocked, rang the bell, called, nothing for 30 minutes out in the cold. He finally comes out and (probably accidentally) admits he had been looking at us in the cameras but didn’t come out.",2
"Fair place to stay in, fair price during winter holidays. Two free bottle of water everyday. Close restaurant nearby. Flexible with unplanned events, but my co-guest wasn’t able to check-in himself. He had to rebook another bus ticket. Laundry is missing. No cash payment. Overall, the hotel is good and responsive to guest requests",5
"It has a great location near Fulton Metro Station, you have great choices in food nearby, like Joe's Pizza, Tacos #1, Simpl, Dumplings and Eataly. You can walk to the Bull Statue, the NYSE and Wall Street. Also a couple of blocks from the Brooklyn Bridge. About the place, the elevator is kind of old but it works fine, the reception is a little small but great. If you plan is to find where to spleep and rest, this is the place for you.",4
"Excellent location, very close to multiple subway stations and local restaurants, and to Central Park was 25 minutes. Felt like a safe, clean area so late night trips back to the hotel felt seamless and stress free. Staff was always polite and flexible. Room were spacious for two people and very clean. Would definitely book again!",5
The location was great. It was right next to the metro. It was a smaller holiday inn than others that ive stayed at but in a prime NYC location it does make sense! Rooms were clean and staff was nice. My boyfriend and I got to the hotel late after going out (around 3am) and we had to wait around 5 minutes for a concierge to come downstairs to hear the doorbell we were ringing.,5
"This destination was perfect. Walking distance to the 4/5, Brooklyn bridge, classic staples like Joe pizza and los tacos! The front desk made our visit seamless and customer service skills were amazing! We will definitely be coming back here. Thank you to Kacey for giving us the smoothest check in process possible!",5
"We were really happy with the value of this stay. Hard to beat the price, staying in Manhattan! Everything was neat and clean, the staff was kind and helpful. We had a little trouble getting the right temperature (heater was very hot) but figured it out. It was bitter cold outside, like below 0 with wind chill, so having the room a little too warm was not a bad problem to have! The bed was comfortable, and we couldn't hear the other guests at all. Just a note, the rooms and hallways are quite small, so not great if you are claustrophobic, but we were fine. Very happy with our stay.",5
Location is fantastic. Staff were kind and helpful. There was slow drainage in the bathroom sink when I arrived and they fixed it quickly. The only challenge is the heating system (winter issue only?). It gets too hot in the room quickly and then too cold again when turned off.,4
"really nice small hotel, has everything you need and they give you free water everyday. really close to WTC and the metro is like 2 blocks away. dunkin next door. great for the price!!",5
Very reliable and clean room. The location is perfect in Manhattan and everything is relatively close by. It was super easy to get checked in and checked out. Would go again.,5
"The location of this hotel was perfect for me! Right in the heart of the FiDi. The hotel let me check in a little early, which I really appreciated. I would recommend this hotel.",4
Great price for stay! Staff was very friendly. It is small but suitable for two people! Walkable to great restaurants & train/subway. Recommend for a short stay. Many attractions nearby!,5
It's a clean cheap hotel with an excellent location. Its very easy to get to the metro. Rooms are a little small but if you are just looking for a place to crash after a long day of tourism/shopping/business etc you would struggle to find a better deal.,5
"Very positive experience at holiday inn. Staff were super friendly and helpful. Room was as described and very clean. Location was ideal, very short distance/few minute walk to subway.",5
"It was the best deal in NYC for this time of year. The staff was receptive, knowledgable and polite. The room and bathroom were clean. It is a 5 min walk from Fulton Center and there a lot of places next to/near the hotel. Overall, I would certainly go back.",5
Beautiful place to stay in Downtown Manhattan. Nearby so many restaurants and near World Trade Center. The room was very clean and the counter hosts were very responsive. Would recommend 100%,5
"Great location! ~Just 5 min walk to World Trade Center; Nice restaurants with abundant options (Chinese, Japanese, Mexican, Pizza, Fast food); They also offer daily perks (some snack and 2 bottles of water per day), which is a nice gesture.",5
We stayed for two nights on a quick weekend getaway and couldn’t have been happier about the location. The staff was very accommodating and friendly and always checked in if we needed anything.,5
"The staff was ESPECIALLY friendly and helpful. Always made sure we knew there were water bottles and maps available; plus popcorn and cookies every afternoon and granola bars in the morning. Loved how quiet the room was - despite being in NYC. And, the neighborhood/area seemed very safe and was so accessible to so many sites, including walkable to Statue of Liberty Ferry and 9/11 memorial.",5
"I don't like to complain, but the hot water is on the cold side in the shower. The sheets were stained, and there was a lot of construction noise at 7 a.m. on a Saturday. The photos don't match reality. There was no water for the coffee. The location is very good, allowing you to walk around the city and have easy access to everything.",3
"Great deal of ~$200 USD for the Sunday before Labor Day! It's right in FiDi, which makes the location great for transit and walking around. It's quieter on the weekends compared to other locations in Manhattan since it's mostly commercial/business buildings on the street. Pier is also close by. You can also leave your belongings at the front desk since it's in the Holiday Inn! :)",5
"Overall great stay! Easy to locate and the check in and check out was very straightforward and fast as well as flexible! Appreciated the responsiveness to any questions as well! Room was very comfy, clean, and had everything needed. Location is great near multiple subway lines that go all over the city!",5
"Cheaper place to stay in a busier area. The room is at an acceptable clean standard but no further. Corner clean and detail areas are missed. HVAC doesn’t respond well and after looking at other reviews, that seems to be common. Room smells (almost like the Indian restaurant on the first floor) not overly awful but noticeable and bothersome enough. Elevator is extremely slow. That said, if you want a hotel that’s as cheap as you can get without danger/ being very dirty, this is a good fit. If you want a clean, quiet place I’d recommend you look elsewhere. (I stay in the city 1-2 nights a week and have been through most of the FiDi area hotels.)",3
"Coming from California and having stayed in hotels across the country and internationally, I felt genuinely comfortable and impressed during my stay at this hotel. The location in New York’s Financial District was excellent, and the overall experience made my visit both enjoyable and stress-free.",5
"The host and the hotel staff made our stay as seamless as possible. Everything was clean and the location was perfect, there were tons of places nearby within walking distance. The Perfect affordable option!",5
"The room was very clean, very comfortable mattress and great pillows. After walking for hours it was nice to jump in bed and relax. Location is great, just a short walk to Battery Park, Walls Street, the bull or Brooklyn Bridge.",5
"I recently stayed at the Holiday Inn and had a great experience! The location is good just a short walk from many of New York City’s main attractions and close to several subway stations like Fulton, making it easy to explore the city. The room was clean, comfortable. The staff was friendly and always available to help with any questions or requests I had. I also appreciated the complimentary Wi-Fi. Overall, I recommend this hotel for anyone visiting New York City. It’s a great value for the location, comfort, and service provided. I would definitely stay here again on my next trip!",4
"The location is really convenient to go to cvs, pizza places and the subway station. Front desk is really helpful and wonderful. The only thing is the room is a little bit small and humidity. But overall was a wonderful stay. Thank you all so much! :)",5
"Clean, pleasant staff, easy access, good location, good value for the NY hotel prices, but lighting in bathroom was poor, had to lift toilet seat to open bathroom door and drains are slow draining.",4
The host is not the actual hotel - it’s like a broker. They sold out of rooms and the host asked me to cancel the reservation at the time of check-in when absolutely it was the host who had to cancel. We had to scramble to find a last minute place. The host stopped answering and customer service had to intervene. Not recommended.,1
Ideal place to stay if you’re wanting to be close/walkable to most tourist attractions. Decent amount of cafes and restaurants nearby. Hotel kept our luggage for us as before and after we checked out which was a massive help.,4
"The Place is just a little smaller than it looks in pictures, don’t expect any views or anything other than that it justifies the price , location is great, famous food option, close to subway, famous tourists attractions are nearby",4
My husband and I enjoyed our stay at Holiday Inn in NY. It was so convenient to the subway and local tourist spots. We also liked that we could leave our luggage in the lobby before our flight back so we could still do some sight seeing.,5
"Looks like the photos, simple hotel with a decent sized room. Great location if you want to explore the financial district then easy transport links elsewhere in the city.",4
"Was cheap and worth it (compared to other nyc prices). The room is small but if all you need that place for is a place to sleep, it’s perfect!",5
Great place near the subway and great places to eat would definitely come back and stay here when I visit New York again!,5
"My wife and I enjoyed staying at the Holiday Inn Wall Street which is three blocks from the New York Stock Exchange on the same street. The receptionist Justine was excellent and handled all kinds of situations. There is an adjacent restaurant called Ane which has delicious American breakfasts and Indian food for lunch and dinner, plus you get a 15% discount on the breakfast when you stay at the Holiday Inn. The rooms are relatively small but have all of the essentials. I would unplug the alarm clock since otherwise it will make a strange sound at an odd time of the morning. You get a decent view of the office building across the street, but more importantly you are within easy walking distance of the entire financial district and other highlights of downtown Manhattan including the Brooklyn Bridge and City Hall Park. Fortunately the room temperature can be adjusted to whatever you prefer.",5
Great staff! Always helpful! Quiet safe neighborhood! Close to awesome food and the subway!,5
Excellent place to stay when in the city. Staff was great and room was clean and comfortable.,5
"I had a very poor experience during my stay. Throughout the entire night, there was a loud clawing/scratching noise coming from the bathroom exhaust fan area. I was not using the fan at any point. The noise was persistent and loud enough to keep me awake all night, and I was unable to sleep before a very early 3:00 AM checkout for a flight. I cannot say definitively what caused the noise—whether an issue within the ventilation system or something else—but regardless, it made the room uninhabitable for rest. Given the impact on my sleep and overall stay, I would not recommend this listing unless the issue is fully resolved.",1
"Enjoyed our stay for the price that we paid. Convenient place that is close to everything, along with the subway being a 5/10 minute walk.",5
"For my friend’s first visit to NYC, this hotel was perfectly located for doing all the classic touristy things. The staff kindly upgraded us to a more spacious room on the 19th floor, and we really appreciated how quiet the hotel was throughout our stay. The staff were not only very kind but also impressively efficient—helping with luggage storage and retrieval, late check-in, and more. I was especially impressed by one staff member, Ms. Zaynah. In the middle of a chaotic check-in rush, she somehow managed to help us reclaim our luggage seamlessly. She expertly “played Tetris” with suitcases in the elevator and corridor, let us grab our bags ourselves, and sent us straight up to our room so we could rest immediately—without wasting a single minute. All of this, with a smile on her face the entire time. Truly unbelievable service.",5
"13 years on Airbnb Rating, 4 stars , · December 2025 It was dated with rips on the desk chair and getting in was difficult because we couldn’t hear over the loud music. Close to subway.",4
"Overall, we enjoyed our stay. The hotel was clean, the staff was friendly, and the location made it easy to explore the city. Would consider staying here again.",5
"A very strategic location , near to subway station ( walkable) . Surrounded with restaurants n businesses district",4
"Location. Location. Location. First-time visitor or seasoned New Yorker, you could not ask for a better location. Walking distance to, well, everything that the Financial District has to offer. From the Stock Exchange to 1 WTC, here's your chance to hobnob with NYC's movers and shakers. Architecture, your thing? Luxury shopping? Be WOWED by both in the design wonder that is the Oculus. Pay a visit to the 9/11 Memorial Site and feel the reverence that all of New York holds for the names etched around the perimeter of the Reflecting Pools. Despite the scaffolding that temporarily obscures the hotel's façade, the building is easy enough to locate. After a good night's sleep on the most comfortable bed and a quick workout in the fitness center, there'd be nothing more welcome than a long, luxurious shower powered by a most generous shower head. The rooms are small but adequate. With so much to see and do, you won't be spending much time indoors.",4
Comfortable room in an excellent location! I would definitely recommend this spot and stay there again.,5
"Great receptionists, accommodated us for our needs & gave recommendations! Space is small but it’s just what we needed.",5
Great location!! Felt lucky to find this place at the height of the Holiday season when so many places were already booked. Worked out perfectly. Will be coming back!,5
"Clean hotel room. Bed and pillows were good. It is a no frills kind of place. Certain areas of the hotel are a bit worn and dated ( the halls, the check in area). Having said that, if you are just looking for a clean place to rest, close to the financial district, then it certainly serves its purpose. There is an additional destination fee of $17.21/daily I was not aware of.",4
"The air conditioner was set at 72 and would not change, the fan only had one setting which was very cold. We did let the hotel staff know it was musty (wet smelling) and very humid in the room. Guests should know that breakfast is not included, and there is a destination fee not included in the AirBNB price. Pillows are very comfortable!",4
"Great stay overall – highly recommend! The location was excellent – super convenient for exploring Manhattan on foot and by subway. The room was clean and quiet, and the bed very comfortable. The staff were consistently helpful, friendly, and attentive. A reliable, pleasant place to stay in NYC. I’d happily return.",5
"The room was a little small but most new York rooms are, it appeared to be very clean, the staff was very helpful and friendly, the location was pretty nice, lots of stuff nearby and a couple of subway stations to get to more distant things easily, the bed was big and comfortable, I would stay again.",5
"My stay here while I was in New York was great! The staff showed me so much love it honestly could’ve just been my personality! The room was spotless it was quiet it wasn’t too far from the subway stations, restaurants in walking distance. The only downfall for me was that the bathroom is so small it was barely enough room for myself and my daughter to share but we made it work! I would come back for sure I felt safe and comfortable.",5
"very solid place to stay. it is clean, has great air conditioning, and it is safe. the bed is fairly comfortable. the ""gym"" advertised is a small room in the basement with two treadmills in it. no weights, nothing else. the hotel has no ice machine or water fountains or dispensers. the system of extending and/or changing your reservation are basically nonexistent, but it's a good place to sleep for as reasonable a price you can find in NYC.",4
"If you are looking for a place to sleep that has a comfortable bed and a bathroom, this is the place for you. If you are looking for luxury, this is not the place for you. I went there with my son and we stayed 5 nights. It was absolutely perfect for what we needed. We left every day in the morning and came back very late to shower and sleep. It’s an excellent location as well with easy access to many different subway lines.",5
"Wonderful for the price! Very convenient if you need to get around in a timely manner and definitely worth the stay just for how much there is to do within walking distance. The room could use some amenities, like a fridge and microwave, but other than that, it was extremely accommodating. Customer service of the hosts was great.",5
Loved my stay at Holiday Inn. This location was so close to everything. I was surprised at the subway system in Manhattan. No car needed as it felt everything was within walking distance. I would reccomend this because it was one the least expensive choices to stay in New York and was close to so much. The host and staff were very friendly.,5
"The Holiday Inn was everything I needed for an extra evening I had in the city. I wanted somewhere that had good connections to the city and this definitely had it. The gentleman on reception who greeted me was very efficient and informative. He explained everything I needed to know. The room itself was exactly as advertised. The bed was comfy, the bathroom was clean and the coffee machine was all I needed and I was happy with that.",5
Double booked our room in the night and someone else opened the door when we were sleeping in.,1
"Very easy check in, discount rate on parking, communicative host!",5
It was a great location in the Financial District. The staff were nice and they fix our hiccups quickly. I would recommend!,5
"Great spot in the Fin. sector of Manhattan, close to railway + foods. Thanks!",5
"Thank you for your hosting, very friendly, and we felt it was worth the stay",5
Staff was friendly and helpful. We felt like we made an excellent choice by staying at this holiday inn. I highly recommend this place.,5
"10 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · December 2025 Amazon location, great hosts. Rooms are very well kept - clean and cosy.",5
"2 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · November 2025 It was value for money. Suitably located for a tourist. Nearly kept rooms. May not be big hotel or big rooms - but the money I paid, it was worth.",5
"Everything matched the description, also the attention was very friendly and the place was very accessible to all places in New York",5
"I wish I could write a better review. The location was great, the price was pretty decent, and everyone we interacted with were, at some level, very friendly. However, the biggest issue was that the Airbnb listing 100% said the room had a king-sized bed in it, and it absolutely only had a full bed. The size of the bed was a big feature in picking the room. After getting into the room and realizing this, I went to the front desk, who were fairly stand-off-ish and didn't seem understanding or all that eager to do anything about it (hotel was full, but no offer of partial refund, etc.). Moreover, they claimed it was a queen bed anyway (it was not, we had a sewing tape measure handy), and that a queen bed was bigger than a king! Airbnb co-host initially seemed friendly too, but was not very proactive at all in trying to resolve the issue either. If you're ok with whichever room/bed you get after booking, and ok with poor help if you run into issue, this could be the place for you!",1
"Great location, however a bit pricey at $400 a night, for a tiny room with a tiny bathroom but it did have a nice comfortable bed.",4
"Overall good stay. The room was nice, if small, and the staff were friendly and accommodating.",5
"This is a standard Holiday Inn - nothing wrong with it, nothing special. Walkable to a lot of little shops & eatery’s. All in all fine for a short stay!",4
Amazing hotel for the price. The room was very clean and had everything in there I needed. Hotel is also located in a great location.,5
"Amazing location, minutes away from the WTC and the 9/11 Memorial Museum. Great spots around to eat. Clean, comfortable and friendly staff willing to help!",5
"Disappointing stay, light switch was not working the whole stay and room smells very musty. Aircon is also very loud",2
"Amazing reception folks, very kind and flexible. Spot on location and value for money. Many thanks to everyone who works for their lovely and kind interaction and help.",5
"Great location, great cost for the accommodations and location. Room was clean and room service was great. Will stay again if travelling back",5
"Very friendly staff and I'm a great location, although only my lamp lights worked in the room",5
"The hotel is in a great location, with metro stations just a short walk away. Very convenient for getting around the city. The stay was okay overall—nothing outstanding, but comfortable enough for a short trip.",5
The location was good and I enjoyed my time however the lack of a microwave and a refrigerator just made the trip less enjoyable especially seeing I was there for 10 days. Staff were great and the room was clean and well kept and the bathroom was Pristine. 6.5/10,4
Best value for the location. Right in the heart of lower Manhattan. Walking distance to many sights. if you are looking for an affordable place to stay in lower Manhattan and dont mind the room being small and a bit uncomfortable this is a great option.,4
Very friendly and accommodating for check-in. The rooms are comfortable—small but perfect for getting a good night’s sleep and having energy for the day. The staff is very kind.,5
We had a great stay at the Holiday Inn (located in the financial district). The staff were all very friendly and helpful. Definitely recommend and would stay there again.,5
"Perfect location. My biggest anxiety was unloading/loading my bags and finding parking. It couldn’t have been easier. They were so so great, and even gave me a discount on the parking garage.",5
All depends what room you get! First week we got nice room and than when we came again the room had few issues with the entrance door and toilet. Overall satisfied based on what you pay,4
"12 years on Airbnb Rating, 4 stars , · July 2025 Easy to get to from the subway. Room was small but all we needed. Staff were great. Hotel looking a bit tired but it was all we needed and was in a good location for us",4
"This hotel was very convenient. If you’re looking for a nice, safe, clean space to sleep, this is a great location . It is small with little space to walk but it served its purpose . Will stay again !",5
"Fast, easy, and friendly check-in. I was worried about parking but it wasn’t too far away. Google map was a challenge to get to the hotel. It kept telling us to turn the wrong way on a one way and did a few too many circles.",5
"Extremely convenient location from subway and staff was attentive! This specific Holiday Inn was a little run down and room was on the warmer side even when AC was turned on (Not ideal during NYC summer). However, overall stay was good!",3
"Space has everything you need and nothing you don't. Quiet and comfortable, clean. Only issue was that there isn't always a person at the front desk to check out. Desk staff was very friendly.",5
"Clean and very convenient, though small—perfect for a quick trip up to the city. They had chocolate chip cookies available at check-in, which was a nice touch! The staff was friendly and accommodating.",5
"Host was responsive and helpful with my questions. Location is great for museums, food, and photo ops. Walkable distance to attractions and the subway. The room was as described, clean, and easy to check-in to.",5
Convenient location Friendly front desk Unpleasant smell in hallway and room AC did not work properly Had to switch it on and off often and heat came on with burning smell so I turned it off altogether Other than that. Some TLC is needed but it did what it was meant to do & price wasn’t too bad,4
"Great location if you want the financial district - walkable to everything. Hotel is no frills but it’s super clean and an excellent value for the price. Would stay again. Hosts are super responsive, friendly and helpful.",5
Super convenient to the lower manhattan area; located in the heart of the financial district. We walked to the Brooklyn Bridge and across to the other side. Took the ferries. Around the corner from Wall Street hubbub. It was fairly quiet for a big city.,3
"Really appreciate their flexibility - I arrived early for a show starting shortly after check-in and they were willing to let me check in as soon as a room was available. The room was great, clean, and quiet. Check out was easy. Very smooth stay.",5
Our stay was a good experience. Off the beaten path but still walking distance to Chinatown/Little Italy and Brooklyn bridge. The room was clean and modern. The only disappointment for us was the ice maker was broken in the vending room. I would stay again.,5
"Absolutely loved my stay at the Holiday Inn NYC - Wall Street! This hotel was so nice, convenient located in downtown NYC and only a short subway ride away from my destination for the night! The staff was very friendly and attentive! They called to check in and make sure that everything is all good with settling into the room and they gave me a fun little gift basket as well! I am very grateful for the warm hospitality given to me by the staff over at Holiday Inn NYC - Wall Street and I look forward to visiting again soon!",5
Valerie the manager was extremely helpful made our stay a great experience.,5
I would stay here again with no hesitation for the right price,5
"Great stay in NYC's financial district, especially considering the price point",5
Convenient easy access to subway It was a good choice for me,4
First time in New York. I love how everything was walkable to everything.,5
Great location. Friendly staff. Clean and comfortable.,5
Very good value! Great location,5
Place was very convenient to everything and clean,5
"Great staff, good restaurant and easily accessible around downtown area and subways",5
it was holiday Inn. it was in FiDi and the price was better than on other portals :),5
"Decent hotel, expensive but so is everything, good location.",3
"We had a great day with the Hilton, I was a little anxious at first with it being on Airbnb, but this was a great fine and 100% worth it. I would definitely stay again!",5
Nice place. Make sure you put in address for holiday since there’s two Holiday Inns around wall street area.,5
It was nice. The room is small. Great place to stay if you are more focused on being out and about in the city,3
"My 14yr old son and I stayed here for a 4 day visit to NYC. Great location, many options for transportation, and many walkable stores and attractions. The hotel room has exactly what you need if you’re needing an affordable place to rest and sleep after a long day or site seeing and roaming around the city. The front desk staff were all very friendly and helpful, checking in and out was a breeze. CVS Pharmacy is up the road if you need to buy anything you forgot, grab a slice of pizza at Joe’s also up the street, TJ Maxx is down the street if you need any clothes or extra luggage. We’d also recommend 7th street burgers- also in the same street. We enjoyed our stay and would stay here again.",5
Extremely clean very understandable about me being late,4
"Very quick and easy, very flexible too",5
Would stay here again. Great location for the price.,5
Ok if staying in the city and fast access to NYC subways,3
A good place to stay in New York with a great location.,4
"clean place, and well located.",5
"Great location , really clean place! I would stay again",5
As described. Nothing unexpected.,4
"Excellent people - friendly, helpful, thoughtful.",3
Great Airbnb host and great location!,5
Great location! Can’t beat that.,5
very good place to explore NYC,5
A very convenient place to stay!,5
Great customer service! A+++ Allowed me to check in 4 hours early.,5
Walkable to many places ! Great staff very friendly,5
Great location and easy check in. Highly recommend!,5
The facility seems to be old and there is no hair dryer inside the bathroom.,3
Clean and easy to get in and out of. Would stay again!,5
It was a great stay the staff was very friendly and helpful and the location is great with easy to access stations.,5
"Location was great! Staff was amazing and attentive! The room was small, but it is New York so it served its purpose. We will be back!",5
"This was my worst hotel experience ever. First of all this hotel looks big on the outside but trust me when you get inside everything is looks like it’s just squeezed together. It’s smells horrible I don’t know if people be smoking in there but all the building smells very bad. I was supposed to stay there for 5days but I only ended up staying for a night because I couldn’t stand the smell. I messaged the Airbnb host and he told me to talk to the manager or the front desk so that they can give me another or solve the problem but I didn’t do that because I knew that even if they give me another it will also be smelling the same because all the building has the same smell. I told the front desk that I will check out the next day which was 08/01/2025 mind you I checked in on 07/31/25. I asked them if I’m going to get my refund and they told me that I will get my refund for the remaining 4days that I didn’t stay there, the security deposit, and the resort fee. The shower was not even worki",1
employees were so helpful and nice. great hotel to come back to after a long day out in the city !,5
"Awful guest service. Their policy was no cancellations. Fine. The date of my trip changed so I tried to change it online which the site let me do as there was availability. They refused to accept the change even though it wasn't in their policies. The worker told me that it was my fault and I should take it up with Airbnb. I tried but the Airbnb system wouldn't let me communicate with them and then closed my case. What pisses me off was that, since then, I've received multiple emails from them, thanking me for my stay and telling me that I was a great guest. That just makes me more annoyed.",1
Amazing location within walking distance of many of NYC’s sights. Good price for the location and offering. Good restaurant on site.,5
"I enjoyed every single moment at this place. Staff is friendly, rooms are extremely clean, bed was comfortable and it felt like home",5
I love how they reached out to make sure if anything was needed. Check I. And check out process was efficient and quick.,5
"Great hotel and location. Within walking distance to Oculus, 9/11 memorial, Wall Street, City Hall, Brooklyn Bridge, subway stations and shopping.",5
"Stay was great, everything was as expected! Room was very clean, bed was comfy, daily water bottles were provided, new towels daily, front desk was very helpful!",5
"First off, Jason was a great and responsive host. We had a few kinks while booking and he was very understanding and helped us. Then, when we were going to arrive after midnight, he accommodated the late check in time. The room was very clean and exactly as described. I particularly appreciated the black out curtains...a dark room helps me sleep much better. The bed was comfortable and there was always a small snack at the front desk. The only thing we did not like is because we arrived after midnight and there is no parking on site(which was mentioned in the posting, this was not deceptive in any way) we had a difficult time finding an open parking garage that actually had availability. Having never been to NYC, wandering around at 130am to find somewhere to park wasn't our favorite. HOWEVER, other than Yankee Stadium everything else was within easy walking distance. Can't beat the price. 5/5!",5
"This was one of the most disappointing hotel experiences I’ve had in over two years of living in New York. When I first entered the room, I found visible mold on the bed, which was disgusting and completely unacceptable from a health perspective. I asked to switch rooms, and while I was moved, the new room was barely functional: • No working outlets (except in the bathroom) • Only one working lamp • TV didn’t turn on due to no power in the room The hotel offered to move me yet again, but I had four large suitcases, and at that point I felt completely exhausted and unsupported. The staff was dismissive, unhelpful, and even borderline rude, making an already frustrating situation feel worse. I paid nearly $200 a night, which is outrageous given the poor conditions and lack of basic amenities. I do not recommend this hotel. The rooms are poorly maintained, the service is lacking, and no one should have to deal with mold, non-functioning rooms, or being treated like an inconvenience.",1
The place was great for the location it offered at its price point. The room was clean and staff was helpful.,5
I will be coming back!! The area is perfect for couples or families close to BK bridge WTC thank you for the experience and the staff is A1 very nice,5
The receptionist was very friendly and helpful. The location is excellent. Definitely worth it! Will come back again! ☺️,5
"Good value with convenient access to wall street; various restaurants and supermarkets close by, 5min away from subway. Would recommend for budget stay in NYC",5
I enjoyed my quick stay at this hotel situated right in the middle of the city. The room was cozy and very comfortable. The space definitely met all of my needs.,5
"9 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · July 2025 I felt really comfortable and peaceful. If I visit NY again. I will reserve again here. Thank you so much.",5
"Perfect location to explore downtown Manhattan. The room is quite small, but the bed is super comfortable!",5
Great location and staff. Very helpful with the parking situation. Close to absolutely everything we had planned to do within walking distance.,5
A very nice hotel for the price. Room was comfortable and clean and the area is relatively quiet at night for New York.,5
"Great for a no frills overnight in the city. Super convenient FiDi location. Very friendly, helpful staff. Room was comfy and clean. Would stay again!",5
"Very Clean, great location, just make sure you don’t put your key card next to phone their sensitive",5
Good place to stay for a single person or a couple. Nice staff and very responsive to requests.,5
"I would consider staying here again, depending on the price. If you’re expecting a great hotel experience, you’ll likely be disappointed. But if you go in with a realistic understanding of NYC accommodations—especially for shorter stays—you’ll probably appreciate the value. The space was quaint and served my needs for the weekend. However, the plumbing could be improved (slow flushing, clogged sink), though it wasn’t a major inconvenience for me. Housekeeping, on the other hand, could do a better job cleaning the bathroom and nightstands—I noticed visible smudges, hair, and other residue. Thankfully, I had my own disinfectant wipes and air spray, but without them, I would have been frustrated. Overall, I liked it well enough to consider staying again, but next time, I’d ensure the room is thoroughly cleaned and everything is in working order.",4
Better than the description!!! A privileged location and easy to find! Everything was very clean and everyone was very friendly!,5
great stay. would stay again,5
Room was a bit cold.,4
great place!,5
"I loved my stay. The area is quite safe and the location is excellent for getting around the city. Getting around by subway is very easy and practical, which makes everything even more convenient. Definitely worth it for the value for money. Highly recommended! Translated from Spanish Show original",5
Very nice place,5
Everything was good and easy.,5
Overall nice.,5
Everything was amazing!!!,5
"The host was terrible at managing the reservation. When I arrived, my reservation did not appear and I had to pay for a new reservation directly at the hotel. He never responded to me at that time. I had to call customer service to have them cancel that reservation Translated from Spanish Show original",1
Horrible stay,1
I was extremely satisfied,5
Thanks,5
Loved it!,5
Good price for a decent location in NYC.,4
"Good communication, clean, easy!",5
Nice place and the location is perfect,5
Simple yet effective accommodation in a great neighborhood.,5
i'd definitively stay here again!,5
"The place is perfect for being in NY, everything is close and for what is far away you can take the subway, which you can enter through several stations that are one block away. Check-in was quick and they let us in before 3 pm, depending on availability. The receptionist was very friendly and lent herself to help us with everything we needed. I would go back to the place if I went back to NY. Translated from Spanish Show original",5
Perfect place to stay for a couple nights in New York City!,5
"Great spot, very clean, smooth as butter check in",5
"I had a great time at this Airbnb accommodation located in the hotel. The welcome at the reception was warm and very professional, which immediately puts you at ease. The accommodation was impeccable, spotless, and the bed particularly comfortable, ideal for a good rest. I highly recommend it! Translated from French Show original",5
"Great location, they let us check in early too",5
Great stay except for the destination fee that isn’t mentioned until right before check in.,4
"Our stay was great! Easy check-in, clean room, and the location was nice for touristing.",5
The room was clean and the staff was great and the room was exactly how it was described,5
Really enjoyed my stay and the hotel the hotel receptionist were all friendly and alot to do in the neighborhood,5
Perfect place to stay in the heart in FiDi. Friendly staff and clean room.,5
"There were a few issues, but the staff was so kind and cooperative. Really good area for tourists!",4
"Best ever location of downtown of manhattan, easily checking in ,with cozy environment",5
It was a great experience . Easy to check into. Just keep in mind of the security deposit since it is a hotel but other than it was great,5
The woman at the front desk was lovely. Any issues were handled quickly and very friendly.,5
"Friendly staff , holds luggage safely if necessary. Nice area transit nearby",5
Great place to stay. We pretty much used it to only crash at night. Excellent location.,5
Great location and reasonably priced considering your in the heart of Manhattan.,5
"it's a great place to stay, nearby are many places to visit and subway station to move.",5
It was a great day for my 24 hours trip the host. Everybody was good. I will be coming back when I come back to New York City.,5
Good location & okay size room for the price. Wish there was a refrigerator or microwave.,3
Love the location and check-in was easy. Appreciate how responsive the hosts were!,4
"They lost our reservation and where ride about it. Everything got canceled and refunded, ruined our visit.",1
"Good hotel, the receptionist was very cheerful and gave clear instructions, close to the financial area and metro. Clean and tidy room, clean bathroom and shower with good pressure and hot water. Spectacular view. Very good location. Translated from Spanish Show original",5
Perfect for an overnight!,5
Great overall!,5
It was a great stay,5
"Clean, easy, direct.",5

Really enjoyed our stay here in NYC. Our room was a home away from home.,5
great stay walkable location & friendly hosts,5
"Okay place for the price. Sometimes hot water, sometimes not.",3
Great place to stay for reasonable rates downtown Manhattan,4
"Everything was perfect! The location, the bed and the personal! I hope Back !",5
It was a great experience. I’ll definitely come back to this place again.,5
The place was good but I just couldn’t find it at night when using the gps.,4
Very friendly small nice size room. Clean and nice stay,5
This is coming from KEONTAE herself !!! The staff was AMMAAAZINNG. Biggest shoutout to Antonio for the smooth check in and Jillian for the warm welcome. I greatly appreciate them truly. Shout out to the housekeeping staff the room was absolutely SPOTLESS!! I will be booking again soon and hopefully I get to see them again! The room was nice .,5
"Great price for New York City with amazing customer service. Every single staff member working the front desk was personable and helpful. The walking distance to multiple subway stations is great, as well as very close to classic sight seeing & beautiful rooftop restaurants and lounges. I would book this hotel again in a heartbeat!",5
"I must say the location was great. Easy and in the middle of everything, lots of subway stations nearby, Joe's Pizza, many restaurants, cafes, and convenience stores. The room was very clean, the bed was comfortable just a small room and bathroom. The description says taxes are about 18% but it's actually around 22-23% explained by the front desk lady. The people were very nice and polite while check-in, overall it was a great stay.",4
"This location was close to many tourist attractions and was just a quick walk to the subway. What a fantastic location!!! Staff was friendly and there had free snacks in the lobby. We felt safe staying here. The bed was comfortable. Loved the full sized Dove products in the bathroom! The room was on the smaller side, but was just perfect for our trip since we didn't stay in the room much. Great location & hotel for us!",5
"The staff were great! Every staff member I encountered was friendly and helpful. The location was also decent and felt very safe. However, the room had a terrible odor that was almost too much. The fan in the bathroom did not work, there were stains all over the floor, and the window shades were broken. I’m not sure if the price justified the state of the room.",3
"Perfect location with excellent price for New York. No need to pay clean fee, they offer complementary breakfast and some snacks, they were super kind and responsive . Perfect location, close to World Trade Center, Brooklyn bridge and 2 blocks to the subway. Only 30 min to Central Park. I’ll definitely come again.",5
"The location is unbeatable, with easy access to major attractions and public transportation. The staff was incredibly friendly and accommodating. The room was spacious, clean, and well-appointed. Overall, I highly recommend the Holiday Inn on Nassau Street for anyone looking for a convenient and comfortable stay in New York City. I can’t wait to return!",5
"12 years on Airbnb Rating, 3 stars , · August 2024 Lovely checkin staff The first room not great so we changed. The coffee machine did not work. The sheets and pillow slips were polyester. The bathroom had Dove washing things not good for anyone. For htis price we would expect cotton sheets and bathroom wash and shampoo that is safe to use. The location and staff great. We are still waiting for the extra money on hold on our visa. this is not good.",3
"Got a great deal so it was worth the price , great staff, lovely room obviously not every window has the perfect view of the city but still a 10/10 experience. The staff at the front desk needs better summer uniforms to make their work more comfortable. There were free and yummy snacks at check in which were appreciated.",5
"This was my second time staying here. The staff, location and room were great. There was only one down side but i'm guessing it has to do with the building itself. There was a small Humidity smell. We were only staying there for one night so It was no problem for us, other than that the room was very clean, the bed was great to sleep in.",4
"Great staff, very good location and good basic services Needs a little bit of cleaning and maintenance (noticeable smell in the hallway and within the room). It's not quiet (You can hear what happens in the hallway and in the next rooms). But it's a good night sleep if you spend most of your day outside the hotel.",4
"Well the Holiday Inn was in a perfect location for myself to do all the things I want to do. Staff wasn’t too friendly the room wasn’t the cleanest, and the hidden fees were a little bit of a shocker being that it was an extra $200 on top of what I already paid for my stay. But overall it wasn’t too bad and I could possibly be back again loved the vacation in New York though.",3
I appreciated the Host giving a heads up about the hotel fees. It has been almost 2 weeks since I checked out and I still have not been refunded the fee that they hold just in case of damages. This is on the hotel not the the Host. The room was as presented in pictures. In walking distance of the subway. The Staff in the Lobby are friendly and answered any questions I had about the area. I would stay here again.,5
"The price-performance ratio was really okay. Unfortunately, there was no breakfast during the time I was there, and when I asked for a hairdryer, it was promised to me, but I didn’t receive it. Those were the negative experiences. Otherwise, it was a clean and quiet hotel. The location was perfect for me, so all in all, everything was good.",4
"Very good experience. The location is one of the hotel's great strengths: it is meters from Fulton Station, which is huge and very practical. From there you can access several metro lines, which makes getting around the city really easy. In addition, the area feels very safe, even at night, something that was key for us. As a nice touch, they kindly give you two bottles of water per day, which were picked up at the front desk. The hosts were always friendly and helpful. The room is small, as is often the case in big cities, but very comforting. The bed, in particular, was very comfortable and allowed us to rest well every day. Some days they also gave us cookies at the front desk, a simple gesture but it added a lot. In short, a well-located hotel, in a safe area, with good service and details that make the stay more pleasant. No exaggeration, it's very good, and we definitely recommend it and would choose it again. Translated from Spanish Show original",5
My wife and I are very happy with this place for travel and recreation. The location is just fantastic. We got a lot of emotions and want to visit this place with children Translated from Russian Show original,5
"They were all very friendly, ready to solve any problem, very good hygiene, good location, good customer service…I would definitely come back Translated from Spanish Show original",5
Great value for money! The room was clean and the bed was very good! The location is excellent Translated from Portuguese Show original,5
Great place. Very conveniently located for both walking and taking the subway. A perfect place to rest after long walks. Translated from Spanish Show original,5
"The space of the rooms is a bit small, however, it is ideal to get to rest and continue exploring the surroundings, there was no change of towels, the staff only made the bed and picked up the trash. Translated from Spanish Show original",4
Nice location and the room service was good,5
"It was nice to be able to get to and from tourist spots such as the World Center Building, the stock exchange, and the ferry terminal to the Statue of Liberty, and even Center Park, in less than an hour.I didn't feel that the surrounding environment was dangerous. Translated from Japanese Show original",4
It was good experience with Holiday Inn,4
The accommodation was ideal for exploring New York City for a few days. We spent 3 nights here. Everything was as described and completely sufficient. The bed was very large. We slept three with a baby in it. Surprising was the one or the other snack that was displayed at the reception. Translated from German Show original,5
Great location and responsive host!,5
Decent place to stay for the money in NYC,3
Amazing service! Really enjoyed my stay!,5
close to everything what do you need,5
I had a great stay and was able to get around easily!,4
Overall it was a fantastic experience!,5
Enjoyed our stay very much. Would stay again,5
tolle Lage im Financial District,4
"GREAT location ,, beautiful room ,, and loads of fun only problems was toilet not flushing (had to lift lid and pull chain ) and couldn’t control heater (broken buttons) but OVERALL great visit and great stay❣️",5
"Get in the hotel smoothly, clean room. It is small but it make sense due to the location. It near the Wall street, World trade center and 911 museum. It's pretty convenient to different places. Also, it has services to store your package. It's so helpful for tourists. Like it and recommend!",4
"The front of the building may look a little ragged but the hotel itself is in incredible shape. Room is clean, nice size for NYC, well equipped and staff is some of the friendliest you will find in the city.",5
1. Room heater was not working. The front office lady provided a small unit of heater and we adjusted for that night. They repaired it next day though. 2. The floor carpets are very old. 3. There is no Microwave oven which would have helped in winter for hot water n other uses.,3
"Great location, close to all the subway lines. Quiet hotel, but our room had a very noticeable smell of urine in a corner of the room. Definitely was not cleaned properly.",4
"NYC hotels tend to have small rooms and lobbies. This was no different. It also shows its years. This is not glamour lodging. However the staff were a delight. Helpful and cheery. The location is great because of the proximity to multiple subway lines. We were going to an event in Brooklyn Heights, and the trip was about 10 mins. The financial district is pretty quiet on the weekend, but there were enough places open. Go to Farida, an Uzbek restaurant, if you want a dining adventure. Walk down to take the free Staten Island ferry and pass the Statue of Liberty.",4
"We had a great stay here. It’s quite conveniently located by the subway, and there is plenty of food and so forth in the immediate area. The price was pretty reasonable considering how expensive NYC is generally!",5
"The room was very clean and comfortable. It was easy to find the place and was very close to the subway, which made it really easy to get to even if you have large suitcases (which I did)",5
Place was amazing and the location was nice. Had good experience staff and liked that they hold your bags for you u til your room is available. Only dislike is that I’ve been waiting for over two weeks for my deposit. It’s still pending,4
"The room and bathroom were clean, the bed was comfortable and this area of the city worked perfectly for us as a base for our two day one night visit to the city. The price was also perfect for our budget. We would stay here again without a doubt.",5
Stayed here for 3 nights. The room was excellent and communication with the host(s) was clear. The hotel is in a great neighborhood with access to lots of things to do and to multiple transit lines. I would stay here again.,5
I feel like my stay should’ve been cheaper for a night considering there’s no breakfast or dinner included at the restaurant. I feel like there should be more security,5
"Great stay in the city close to lots of attractions, including Battery Park & World Trade Center. The staff was soooo friendly and helpful! Would totally stay here again.",5
Had a great stay at Holiday Inn! Great location with a lot of food options within walking distance. Room was clean and bed was super comfy. This is a great place to stay if you find yourself near the financial district!,5
"Close to metro stations, be ready to pay extra fees, the rate you pay by airbnb isn’t the final amount, there are more charges, the place need maintenance, bad smell in the bathroom’s curtains, the closet’s door was damaged, scratches in the bathroom door.",2
"My stay at this hotel was not as expected. When I arrived, the room was not properly cleaned, and I found two dirty towels on the floor of the bathroom. Additionally, there were no clean towels provided, which was quite disappointing. I contacted Airbnb to address the issue, and they were helpful in resolving the situation by offering a partial refund. However, I believe that basic cleanliness and attention to detail should be standard for any stay, especially at this price point. I hope the management will take steps to improve the cleanliness and service for future guests.",2
Room was as described. It was clean and neat. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Location was great for all the downtown attractions. Would recommend and stay again.,5
"Great location, walkable to metro station and downtown. They cleaned the room and change towels every day. The reception was nice and helpful. The room is not big but good for a couple or a single person. I just loved it!!",5
"Great location and nice staff! Rooms were comfy and clean. However, our air conditioner unit made us cough a lot and smelled of mold. We decided not to stay another night because of this and got out as quickly as we could.",3
"We had brown water in the shower and tap (because of a broken main pipe), which smelled like sevage, and a blocked shower drain so the water stayed in the tub. The hotel manager changed us to a new room, but that one had a very moldy smell. Staff was very nice though. In the end we did not realize we had to pay heavy tax on arrival so the price you see on airbnb is not accurate. It ended up being much more expensive than other hotels would have been in the area. I cannot recommend at this price.",3
An affordable stay for the price point. Has all the amenities most Holiday Inn’s would have. Good staff and very accommodating to any questions you might have. There are still taxes and security deposit that will have to paid in addition to the price listed in Airbnb.,5
This place is so convenient. I have been several times for business since it’s close to where I need to be and plenty of shops and the transit. The staff is 100% responsiveness and friendly. Never had any problems …. Except no fridge or microwave! Good thing there’s tons of places to eat nearby.,4
The room had a bad smell and the air felt very damp. There was mold in the bathroom and in some spots of the bedroom. The room was smaller than expected & not very comfortable. Convenient location though. Would not stay here again.,3
"It was a good price for the location, but remember about the hidden fees. The room was tiny and had a weird smell to it, but it was clean enough, and the sheets and towels were replaced daily. An okay deal for a weekend in NYC. If you book directly with Holiday Inn you’ll avoid an Airbnb fee.",3
"The hotel is a little old in the common areas. There was confusion about room availability that led to some delays in check in. The room was fine. Adequate. The location isn’t on the nicest street, but its proximity to Fulton Center and Wall Street is ideal. The value for the location is very good.",3
Loved our stay here! Would definitely return. Easy access to train and perfect walking distance to get around the city. Great places to eat right around the corner. The staff were super helpful and responsive to our needs.,5
The bagel shop (pizza) down the street from the holiday is an amazing breakfast place and highly recommend! This location was close to all the major attractions and easily accessible to public transits. Perfect for a quick New York getaway!,5
"The hotel was very conveniently located. As an hotel it was clean and the staff was helpful and friendly. However, we had to pay some extra money at check in that was not communicated before",2
"It was exactly how you’d expect. Be warned about those fees, though — With our last minute stay, it made sense despite the fees, but it might not be like that for everyone.",5
"Excellent option for a quick stay in the city. The location is right next to the Fulton subway stop, with easy access to the rest of the city. The space was clean if not particularly large, totally fine for a short trip where you'll be spending most of your time out and about in the city anyway.",5
"We needed an affordable place to stay for a short 48 hour trip to NYC. I've stayed at this Holiday Inn previously, so I knew the location would be a hike to our planned activities. The bathroom in our room had some comical features - the bathroom door has a notched spot so that it will open past the toilet and the curved shower rod was bent inward at the center for the same reason. 🤣 There were blackout shades, the bed was comfortable, the room was cool, the TV was fine. There're plenty of places to grab delicious food right there, even on the weekend.",5
"Very clean space. Public transportation is very close and you are in around 20 minutes e.g. at the Times Square. If you are outside late at night (after 2am), you are basically stranded so you should try to be back earlier. That’s the reason why the location was a little bit inconvenient for me personally. But most of the must sees are pretty close and it is pretty calm at night too so I can definitely recommend this place.",5
"I had an amazing stay! The host was incredibly kind and attentive, making sure I had everything I needed. Her hospitality made me feel very welcome and comfortable. I would definitely love to stay here again the next time I visit New York!",5
"5 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · December 2025 I had an absolutely wonderful time staying with Odalis. I felt so much at home! Odalis is a very warm host and she will make sure you feel comfortable during your stay! I loved staying with her and talking to her! I will definitely stay here again when I visit the next time👍🏼",5
"I had a great stay at Odalis’s place. She was a charm to deal with -- warm, accommodating, and always ready to help. The room was spotless, and the bathroom was just as clean. She even made me coffee twice, which was such a nice touch. The location worked really well for me. It’s close to the bus stop, and the ride to Port Authority takes just a little over 30 minutes. Super convenient. I highly recommend staying here. Odalis really knows how to make guests feel welcome.",5
"Had a great stay at Odalis’s place during my New york trip. She is the best host ever!! Clear instructions, great communication and went out of her way to make sure I was comfortable! She even offered me food when I arrived very late, exhausted and most restaurants were closed by then, and treated me like friend/ family!! She is the sweetest lady 🙂💕 I would highly recommend her airbnb!! Short walk to bus stops that take about 25 mins to get to 42 street Downtown NY. Thanks for your hospitality and kindness! 💕 Muchas Gracias!! 🙏 😊",5
"Odalis is such a lovely hostess. She made staying in West New York a breeze, and was excellent at instructing how to navigate the area using buses. The space itself is kept pristinely clean and Odalis is a wonderfully responsive host. She offered coffee and food. Will definitely be returning!",5
"Very warm and enthusiastic host. The house is clean and in a good location, close to a main avenue with lots of shops and restaurants. Thank you for everything Odalis!",4
"nice and very welcoming. place is very clean, and she is very helpful. good proximity to public trasport.",5
"Really nice host, very responsive and gives lots of advice for nearby bus routes into New York. Quiet area and short walk from views of the city from across the river and only 20 minutes on bus from port authority station. Room is exactly as described and pictured and host provided some water bottles which can be stored in a small fridge in the room. Checking in and out is very easy and if you ever have any questions Odalis will respond quickly",5
"It was actually a great place to stay in NJ if you come to travel to NYC, you can’t find better place to stay than here. Additionally, transportation was good, at least it was easy to get to New York, and host Mrs. Odalis is so kind and welcoming person. 5 star place!",5
Very nice stay. Will stay again. Odalis is a very nice host.,5
"I felt very comfortable in Odali's home! She is a super warm and caring person. Everything was very clean and pleasant. I also really like the neighborhood because it's not yuppie New York, there are lots of nice little stores around the corner. At the Community Laundromat, a load of laundry costs 3 dollars, and there is very good coffee at Shaky's Juicebar & Cafe. The buses to Manhattan are frequent, a one-way ticket costs 4USD and you can easily pay by credit card. It's quicker to take the express lines which cost the same. It really is a very nice and well connected area. It's worth staying at Odalis :) Thank you Odalis! All the best and take care!",5
Staying with Odalis was one of the highlights of my trip. She had an incredible way of making me feel at home from the moment I arrived. Thank you for me and for being such a great host and becoming a friend :) Staying with Odalis was a pleasure and one of the best parts of my trip. She is very generous and welcomes you with the trust and warmth of an old friend. Thank you very much for opening the doors of your house and for being a great host :) Take care of yourself!

"I loved being here, she is extremely affectionate, attentive, helpful, she became an extension of my home. I felt welcomed. The location is great, just 1 bus and I arrive in downtown New York. The environment has everything we need, she offers treats (mineral water, coffee, Coca-Cola). Always gives tips and suggestions for tours, explains how to get there, what is the best time to do the tour. PERFECT!!! 😃 Translated from Portuguese Show original",5
"I recommend warmly. Peaceful neighborhood, nice, clean room, comfortable bed, lovely shared bathroom. Friendly and welcoming. <3",5
Great room very close to NY,5
"I am very grateful to Odalis for the warm welcome and the house. Reaching New York is very easy and takes approximately 30-40 minutes in general. The house is located away from noisy areas, which makes it safe even for walking at night. The house had everything you need, and more. The hostess gave a very warm welcome, suggested tours and gave tips. If I ever visit New York, I will definitely return to this beautiful woman's house! Translated from Russian Show original",5
I loved staying at Odalis' house. She was warm and friendly and I will definitely be staying at hers if I come back to New York.,5
"The stay with Odalis was perfect, easy to get to from anywhere, plus Odalis gave us directions to make access to the house and communication with New York even easier. The house is very clean, clean sheets and towels, well equipped for the cold and heat. The area was safe and quiet. Odalis is a wonderful woman, she was always attentive to us. We are a Spanish couple who traveled to New York to visit the city for a fantastic week and it exceeded all our expectations. We took many incredible experiences from this trip, undoubtedly one of them is having met a person as good as Odalis. If you're hesitating, don't think about it, it's a great option. Translated from Spanish Show original",5
"I felt at home, Odalis is a very kind lady, willing to help and advise with places, means of transport etc. I would not hesitate to stay with her again when I return to NY. An excellent person. Translated from Spanish Show original",5
"Excellent place, super clean and Odalis is always available for any questions. The neighborhood is very quiet and has many supermarkets and places to eat. The bus stop is 3 blocks away and the ride to downtown Manhattan takes 25 minutes. Highly recommended Translated from Spanish Show original",5
"Great place to stay not too far from NYC, Odalis was very welcoming and kind!",5
This stay felt like a safe home away from home. Oxalis had a beautiful spirit and a charm about her that was very inviting and kind. She was very generous and clean. Made the process of protecting your space and your belongings simple and ideal. There are keys provided for locking your room and the house upon travel. I would definitely recommend staying here. I hope to stay again in the future!,5
Staying with Odalis is like staying at your favourite Aunt’s. She is so welcoming and friendly and made me feel right at home. Her house is spotless and cosy. The location is great for transportation to NYC. Really nice neighbourhood that was peaceful and well kept. Very close to Bergenline Ave that has plenty restaurants and bars. Highly recommended! Thank you so much for looking after me ! 🥰,5
"A hidden gem! A nice, quiet haven after a day in NYC. It’s the first stop after crossing the Lincoln Tunnel, so getting around is a breeze. Adolfo was very friendly and quick to respond. The Airbnb felt very private and had lots of thoughtful amenities like a lint roller, new mini tooth paste, wash clothes/ towels, snacks, coffee, etc. Would 100% recommend! Thank you Adolfo!",5
"The apartment was spotlessly clean and very cozy. The bed in the guest room was comfortable. Extra points for the love of plants :) The location is excellent: the bus stop is just a one-minute walk away and provides easy access to Manhattan. Hamilton Park is about a 10-minute walk and offers stunning views. I also found great restaurants nearby, as well as shops within walking distance. Adolfo was very helpful whenever I had questions and always respected my privacy. Overall, I was very satisfied with my stay and would warmly recommend this place.",5
"We really enjoyed our stay. Adolfo was always very helpful and responsive to everything we needed. The place is close to the bus stop, with easy access to Manhattan. We would definitely stay here again.",5
"It was a delight to stay at Hjordys' place, as it was the ideal location for me. I was there to run the New York City marathon and could easily access all the event venues that I was required to attend over the weekend. I would have no hesitation in recommending Hjordys' place and would certainly look to return if I ever came back to New York to run the marathon again!",5
"Everything was awesome. The bed was so comfortable and i like hjordys house a lot. He is so friendly and he also gives me típs to go around the city of NY, facilities to get the bus and everything i needed. Thank you very very much I recomend staying here a lot.",5
"One of the best places I've ever stayed at! Very well equipped, clean, and cozy, just 15 minutes from central Manhattan! The owner is super helpful and friendly, it's like staying with a cool cousin! 😄 100% would recommend!",5
"The stay was exactly how we expected it to be. Cozy bedroom where we could rest well after exploring the city all day. Close vicinity to bus stops and grocery stores helped us a lot. Bathroom and amenities were clean. All in all, good stay.",5
"Very clean and comfortable! Helpful and friendly hosts. Very close to Manhattan, affordable, and worth it.",5
Absolutely fantastic stay! I was given simple instructions on how to get to the city and felt very taken care of. Perfect location and would definitely stay again!,5
"Had an excellent stay here! Adolfo was personable and welcoming which made shared spaces no problem at all! The kitchen, bathroom, and bedroom were all incredibly clean with personal touches such as the many happy houseplants. Street parking was surprisingly easy and the surrounding neighborhood had plenty of nice places to dine in! This apartment was right next to a bus stop and the ferry to New York was less than 10 minutes by car or bus. Overall I'd say that this spot is cozy and charming with a lively cityscape nearby! A good place to rest your head for the night if you plan to visit NYC without having to pay NYC prices.",5
"We loved our stay! Very close to Manhattan without paying the high rates. Our host was professional, friendly and very helpful. The apartment was nice and cool with the AC running as it was very hot out. The neighbourhood is friendly, clean and offers incredible views of Manhattan. I would absolutely recommend the listing to anyone looking for a weekend in New York. Thanks for having us!",5
The home was very clean and I got a good nights sleep. One thing I wished I had known before booking was that the common areas were shared with someone who spent the evening in the living room watching television somewhat loudly. It was awkward and I did not feel comfortable using that space or the kitchen (which you have to walk through that space to get to).,4
"This was my second time staying here and it was just as wonderful as the first. The host is incredibly friendly and communicative — quick to respond and always helpful. The space is spotless; I honestly wish I could give 6 stars for cleanliness. Everything was thoughtfully prepared, and it felt like a home away from home. Highly recommended and looking forward to coming back again!",5
"I booked this airbnb for 8 days, so far this has been the best experience I have ever had with booking a place to stay. The airbnb was super clean, everything is really well organized. Adolfo was very respectful throughout my whole stay, greeted me and showed me around the place, showed me where I can find what I might need etc. He has some plants in the kitchen that lifted the whole environment, it felt super cosy to be there. Manhattan is just a 10 minute trip away, bus station is right around the corner, buses come every 5 minutes or so. Getting back from manhattan can be hard at first but really easy afterwards, Adolfo does a great job with explaining how the Port Authority bus terminal works. The area surrounding the place is also very safe, there is a really nice park close by where you can see the beautiful manhattan skyline. I spent a couple hours around night time there to chill on a bench and read. Do yourself a favor and book this home. 100% worth it in every aspect.",5
"Highly recommend! Reasonable price, very close to mahattan. Safe community to walk around even at late night. The restaurants close by are top notch. Hjordy is a very thoughtful host. Will definitely book again",5
"The place is very close to NYC, about a 8 minute bus ride over. Host is very responsive and chill, and the place is very clean. Overall my time there was fine since I was mostly in NYC for most of my stay. Would recommend anyone to book their place.",5
The host is really nice and friendly. The place is very good and convenient with commuting to NYC. It will take 5-10 minutes by bus to reach Port authority. The place has good restaurants and stores nearby. I would recommend this place to stay and the NYC,5
I had a really good stay and great place to come back and rest and retreat from days in new York. I liked the location. the hosts had really presented a very clean place and there was awesome coffee and breakfast items. I slept really well both nights! thank you very much,5
A Native New Yorker and a great host. Adolfo keeps his place spotless and won't hesitate to go the extra mile for anyone. If you feel insecure about traveling to NYC this is the host for you.,5
"14 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · June 2025 Adolfo was a fantastic host and the room was excellent - all you could wish for, really. The neighborhood is nice and quiet, and it's super easy to get to Manhattan by bus. Would definitely come back!",5
Lovely place to stay! Adolfo is a very kind and gracious host and an excellent communicator. The apartment is very nice and clean. It's located near some amazing food options and is very close to the bus lines that take you direct to port authority in NYC.,5

We had a great time and we’d love to stay here again someday!,5
"Chris's place was fabulous! Very comfortable, spacious, clean, and well thought out with amenities. Good connection to Midtown also. Will stay here again when we come back!",5
"Chris was so welcoming and kind. He made us feel right at home from the moment we arrived. He took the time to explain everything in detail and gave us great local recommendations. Chris responded very quickly and made us feel extremely comfortable and safe. Would highly recommend staying with him and especially in the Desert Rose Room, it’s fabulous 💞🌸🌷🌹✨🪩✨",5
"This place is truly a gem! Chris’s listing looks just as beautiful as in the photos. I was amazed at how comfortable the room was, and you can really feel Chris’s thoughtful hospitality. The kitchen and bathroom were equally clean and well-maintained. I stayed here for one night, and the surrounding neighborhood was very quiet and safe. It’s also super convenient, just two blocks from the subway station! I would definitely come back again.",5
"The Best host I could imagine, helpful, open, easy-going. Apartment is very calm, nice, separated from the rest of house so You could feel private. Location is the biggest advantage (on top of Chris ;) - 20min from Manhatann, calm neightbourhood, supermarket on the corner, great dinners in 5min. Highly recommended!",5
"The room was exactly as described, clean and beautiful. Chris let us leave our luggage even after the check out. The localization of the apartment was near a subway station, 5 min walk. Chris is very kind and helpful. Thank you for having us :)",5
Look no further this reservation was definitely the right decision. Chris was so flexible and friendly and I slept so comfortably and just a little extra added details that Chris provided really made it a wonderful day and I definitely will be coming back again.,5
"It was nice and spacious, clean and comfortable. Located in the perfect place not far from a train station and there were lots of good places to eat nearby. Easy and secure!",5
"6 years on Airbnb Rating, 5 stars , · October 2025 I had a wonderful stay in the Desert Rose room at Chris’s place in Sunnyside, Queens. Chris was a very kind and thoughtful host who put a lot of effort into welcoming me to the space, showing me around and making sure my stay was comfortable. Chris has also done an amazing job with the room, which is very large by NYC standards and has everything you need to enjoy your stay. The area is a peaceful community with lots of families, but also very close to the 7 subway line and lots of great restaurants nearby. It was a joy to stay with Chris and I have no hesitation in recommending Chris’s place to other guests, you will have a lovely time.",5
"Cleanest and biggest place I could find in Queens area. Just a 5min walk to the train station so, it was perfecto! Plus, I was welcomed by Tony, the co-host. Truly a great experience.",5
"I was impressed with great communication and kindness of the host. The place is accurately described. It’s located in safe working middle class neighborhood in Long Island city and is conveniently located with a metro stop nearby. If I return to the city, I’ll definitely stay again.",5
"Meeting Chris was a highlight of my brief time in NYC~ Chris's place was comfortable and clean, with lots of glorious pink decor. He went above and beyond to welcome me and add fun details and thoughtful touches to the room. I felt right at home and really enjoyed chatting with Chris. There's a nice little healthy cafe just up the street with yummy juice, açai bowls, salads & falafel which added another layer of coziness and comfort to my experience. I'd stay again with Chris!",5
"comfortable stay, room is stocked with ammenities",5
Very cute stay. I enjoyed my time and wish I could have stayed longer!! I would definitely rent again!!,5
"Excellent room, as described by Chris, very spacious and close to the subway, the 40th Street station is just three blocks away, there is a supermarket and several useful businesses near the place. Communication was very fluid and I got a response shortly after writing to him. I would definitely go back with Chris. Translated from Spanish Show original",5
Great place that we can highly recommend and already booked for our next trip ☺️,5
I feel this will be the nicest place in the area for sure. Right by the train station as well. Will be returning soon!,5

Very responsive host. Clear instructions. Accommodation close to metro line 7. I recommend it! Translated from French Show original,5
"Our stay with Chris was amazing, it's a room with all the amenities, excellent location and close to everything to do whatever you want. For a couple, you will have everything in the room, even if one day it rains, you have an umbrella and many more details that make you enjoy the whole house. If you're a woman, you'll find a comfort that I haven't seen in other Airbnbs. You can put on makeup as if you were at home. It's like your own room. We also needed something and Chris offered to buy it just because we didn't have it, that makes him an excellent host. We highly recommend this place! Translated from Spanish Show original",5
"excellent place for couples or groups of two people, very spacious, clean and comfortable. Super connected Translated from Spanish Show original",5
great place! ok location,5
Lovely stay. Will be back!,5
"Chris' place was excellent! He was both friendly and very welcoming. All the instructions and description of the place were clear and accurate.. and communication throughout the stay was also very prompt whenever I had any questions. The room itself was clean and well organized with a comfortable bed and the shared bathroom was well maintained. The place is about a 10 minute walk from the nearest subway station, but the neighborhood and general area was safe and peaceful. It also has a good amount of restaurants and bars on the main street by the subway. The kitchen itself was nice and clean but I didn't do any cooking myself. I would recommend this place to anyone who is wanting a peaceful and clean stay in a safe neighborhood.",5
So cozy and great place to stay. Bathroom was also clean. Host is friendly. Such a good place to stay.,5

"A spotlessly clean space. The room was compact but perfectly comfy for one, bed was extremely cosy, I could not ask for more. Location was excellent, convenient to the subway and with a multitude of great eateries around. Daniela was also super nice and her instructions were clear. Highly recommended!",5
The apartment is beautiful and the room was super comfortable Daniella is a wonderful host replies really quick to inquiries. Sunnyside is a beautiful neighborhood delicious Delis and cool bars around but the killer move is how close the subway is. Legit no longer than a 5 min walk to it and then a 20 min subway ride to Manhattan. Definitely will be my first choice when I plan a trip to NYC.,5
Daniela was a fantastic host. She was very responsive and was only too happy to do anything she could to make the stay the best it could. She went above and beyond and I was really grateful for that. I couldn’t recommend Daniela highly enough as a host. The apartment is very close to the local subway making it quick and easy to get into Manhattan and wider New York.

"This is definitely one of New York’s finest hosts. Could rate this host and property more highly. Daniela was really helpful and the apartment cost, spotlessly clean and quiet. It’s the first property with a comfortable mattress AND pillows. Make this you go to as it is now for me.",5
"I stayed for just one night while in town for an interview and had a wonderful experience. The apartment was spotless, comfortable, and thoughtfully designed. What really stood out was my host’s incredible kindness and generosity. Despite recently having knee surgery, she went above and beyond when I asked to store my luggage during the interview, she even made an extra set of keys so I could access the apartment after check-out. I felt genuinely cared for and so appreciated her thoughtfulness and flexibility.",5

A wonderful room and very clean apartment close to the subway. The area was walkable & convenient. Hosts were friendly and helpful. Highly recommend.,5
I cannot overemphasize how helpful Daniella was as a host. She gave me extremely helpful instructions on accessing the property and was a very hospitable host. The location in Queens has many local eateries and is easily accessible to Manhattan and any point East you can think of. Definitely recommend this place for your stay in New York.,5
