I’ve stayed in a hostel once before, and this one is nothing like what I imagined a hostel to be. The place is wonderfully cozy, warm, and has a homey feel. The location is excellent, the pods are comfortable, place is squeaky clean and the staff is amazing.
On top of that, they even offer breakfast and really great coffee for guests. For the price and location, it’s unbeatable. I would definitely stay here again!

The people in the photo (hosts) are not the people I ever saw at this location and don't seem to be on site. It was as described, and you should know that it is run by Hare Krishna. They are doing great work and offer simple meals at any time of the day to anyone staying. Everything was clean, and all of the hosts were friendly! I would stay here again!

I love this place! As newbie coming into the city for work trips, this hostel is perfect for a couple days. The location is an easy walk from penn station, the staff is kind, and the place feels safe. Inside, it is clean, welcoming, and warm with snacks and coffee. The only issue I had were the late arrivals, 11 pm or 12 am, keeping me awake when I had to work in the morning. Otherwise, it's is great for a solo trip!

My husband stayed here for one night and then had to leave it was so bad. Hugely misrepresented in the airbnb photos and reviews. The cubicles were like cells. It was horribly loud, you could hear literally everything. He said he heard talking, snoring, and farting well into the night and even with earplugs he couldn't sleep. Bodily functions don't obey quiet hours. The hosts were kind and it was clean but this is bare bones. Is it really so expensive to put up some real walls? At least old school hostels used to have actual rooms.

Thanks for your feedback, Laura. We're glad your husband liked our vibe and cleanliness. You're right - this is a basic place, but it's safe, peaceful, centrally located, and about as quiet as this type of accommodation can be in NYC.
We're sorry if some of the details in the description were overlooked. That can sometimes happen when a reservation is made on someone's else's behalf. We appreciate your patience and apologize for any inconvenience your husband may have experienced.
With gratitude,

The staff is great, the room is clean, and the overall atmosphere is cozy. The team was very attentive and strongly emphasized the importance of keeping quiet. During the night, I understood why.
Since the cubicles are not closed at the top, you can hear absolutely everything other guests do during the night. For me, this was unbearable, and I had to cancel my reservation the following day.
I only recommend this place if you are a very heavy sleeper.

This place was fantastic for the budget. I couldn’t ask for more. The daily free breakfast of bread, milk, and fresh fruits basically pays for itself to a certain extent. The room is small so it’s perfect for people that just need a place to sleep. But one thing to note is that you can’t bring any meat product in the building - which includes eggs and any canned food. It was a challenge for me to find affordable high quality protein for myself that needs to be eaten outside, so keep this in mind.

Amazing prime location,  and very good price for that location.
But some conditions like no non vegetarian foods allowed and lack of roof(everything is audible to everyone in that floor); these conditions are little harsh. 
But they were mentioned clearly while booking the room, so read throughly.  Definitely need to vacate, if we violate the conditions.
Other than food and sound privacy, host is amazing and friendly, very responsive and respectful. Nice location and price.
Check conditions and book.

This was my second time at this location. I had stayed at the New York Spirit Retreat (same location 4th floor) earlier and was pleasantly surprised to see the difference in comfort at Interfaith- the bathrooms are much more spacious and the space overall is much more comfortable.
Love the common area on the 3rd floor. As a vegetarian myself, I loved that no meat, eggs and fish are allowed. The staff is responsive and amiable. I loved reading, praying and connecting with more folks at the building. The muffins were my favorite.

Booked for 4 day 3 nights, but couldn't stay there after the first night and checked myself into a hotel. 
Everyone around you is snoring; and they employ a Chinese lady at night to keep watch and wake up snorers - but you can't sleep either way. 
25 cubicles with beds 3/4 size of a single bed, and only 3 bathrooms and showers, walking around in circles to get there. 
If you're on a tight budget this might be for you, but if you have some standards book yourself a hotel.

PROS: Location is top notch. The staff is VERY friendly. Shared bathrooms/showers very clean. Water machine broke one day and was immediately worked on and fixed. The staff is great. Love that they offer drinks and small snacks at all hours. Staff member there at all times.
CONS: It is small- so do you research and check measurements- I'm 5'9 and the bed was too small for me. I hit my head twice in the bathroom- but again they do list measurements in listing so just make sure room would work for you.
My biggest complaint is the noise. They do their best- but there are snorers. You will hear MULTIPLE alarms going off all before 7am (some being hit on snooze or just left on for minutes at a time) and even though they have ""quiet hours"" there will phone calls/facetimes all around you. The best sleep I got was midday- but my sleep was severely affected unfortunately by other tenants. So it's the roll of the dice and hope you get decent people with manners.
Besides the noise- great stay.

Great solution if you want to stay for a few nights in Manhattan on a budget! Perfect location, quite clean, friendly staff available 24/7, breakfast included.
The ceiling of the cubicle is open, so you'll get the snores (and smell) of your neighbors, but it's clearly communicated in advance. I stayed 6 nights; during two nights the staff woke up others to stop them from snoring, and one night  the police even came because someone didn't collaborate. The staff handled everything very well though and I never felt unsafe, but even with earplugs I found it sometimes difficult to sleep. 
Lastly, Im 6'3"" (190 cm), and didn't fit flat on the bed as it was a bit short. Luckily I'm a side sleeper!
Would definitely recommend and come back as well! Thanks a lot!

This place is budget-friendly, and has a walkable distance to great restaurants and metro stations. The hosts are easy to communicate with; the staffs are professional and available 24/7; the restroom is surprisingly clean with spotless toilets. 
As mentioned in the description, the rooms are not soundproof. I appreciate the hosts for being upfront on this issue, and for their efforts in maintaining the quietness, such as having the quiet hour from 8pm-8am, and providing the earplugs. However, there are about 10--20 guests, so it is hard to make sure that everyone stays quiet throughout the night. I am kind of a light sleeper, but I am on budget, so I tried this place; I turn out to be ok with staying for one night, but two nights or anytime longer starts to be difficult for me.

Definitely recommend to people who are solo travelers. I always wanted to go to NYC alone but did not want to pay 200$ by myself for a hotel room. Also I love watching musicals, going to jazz bars so saving money by staying in New jersey was a bit tricky.
I would say this is the best place if u are wanting to enjoy the night of NYC + want to stay close to the penn station. It is 5 min walk from Penn station and the broadway is 7-10 min walk. The famous Jazz bars which I love to go, birdland is also 7 min walk. Absolutely loved it.
About the bathroom, I kinda have anxiety of sharing bathrooms but to my surprise it was always clean. Loved it. 
The only thing I will say is about the bed size. It was fine with me to sleep on but I do not think you will have a good sleep if you are a big person, tall or big :) 
Anyways the staff members are also nice and u can drop your bags in the place which is really helpful if u r planning to immediately start hanging around in NYC.

If you’re looking for basic room and amenities in the center of NYC’s Times Square, Hilton Garden Inn is a great place to stay. The price is right and it’s a walking distance from a lot of touristic attractions. 
I prefer a quieter location with more amenities for an extra price per night. But this was perfect because it was a walking distance from my conference.

On a solo weekend trip (and as a former New Yorker who knows NYC fairly well), I chose this hotel for its central location and walkability, cleanliness, safety, and a good night's sleep. 
It's in an excellent location right by the Times Square train station with access to a million lines to take you anywhere, a quick walk to/from Penn Station train station (as I'd be taking the NJ Transit from Newark airport), and a quick walk to Broadway shows and many key NYC sites like Empire, Rockefeller, Bryant Park, etc.
As it's in a central busy location with Times  Square's constant bright lights, I always felt safe walking back by myself even at 2am. There is always a security guard at the front door too.
This is a no frills not super fancy place, but is excellent for a reliable clean room, unbeatable location, safe area for solo traveler, and quiet sleep. Lobby staff were great and friendly.  
You're paying for location here to maximize time spent out in NYC, not a luxurious hotel stay.

The host is not actually the hotel itself, but an intermediary on Airbnb. When we arrived at the hotel, the hotel had not received the reservation details, and together with the hotel manager Joe. we had to reach out to the host to obtain the required information. The whole process lasted about an hour or so. Joe the hotel manager was very helpful and understanding, and treated us very well while we had to wait to sort this out. Other than that, all was great, the location especially is hard to beat. The price was much higher than normal though, due to the dates (during UNGA80). All in all, a great place to stay, and we would stay again."

We had great service at the hotel and the ability to check our bags the last day while we explored before our flight was so convenient. There is so much to do near this hotel. We will be back again for sure"

The location is great. Just beside Times Square metro station, and a few blocks from the best Broadway theaters. The hospitality services are very good, and they have some complimentary goods for the guests that make the stay even more comfortable. The room services are made every day, keeping the room always clean and well organized. A very good choice for a fair cost-benefit stay at the Times Square area.

The Hilton garden Inn was incredible, it is really near to Times Square, and others importants attractions on NYC such as Rockefeller center and public library, the room is a little be small but it is perfect to rest after a long day, it's very quiet and comfortably.
The hotel has in the lobby an store that is good for a little snack of beverage.

We planned a trip to NYC to go to Broadway and see some shows. This Hilton is perfectly situated and close to everything. It was under renovation, but our room was fine. The bed was comfy, there was hot water and plenty of towels. Aside from that we were out the door every day. One nice thing they did was hold our luggage after the last play we saw, before we headed out of town.  Really appreciated that!

It came as a surprise that my room was not made after the first day. Upon asking,  I was informed it was every second day. 
I was also charged an additional $94.76 which was not specified when I booked. Including ""destination charge"" (what was that for??) and four different line items of City Tax.
The Destination Charge is a hidden fee relating to ""non-optional"" services provided at the property. It was non-avoidable, and a should have been part of the booking rate. Very sneaky and unethical of Hilton to operate this way.

I have given this hotel one star because of being charged twice for taxes. The hotel itself was good, great area, quite for location, clean bathroom so no complaints there. Negatives were common areas etc need refurbishment but this is of reflected in the price paid. Only 3 elevators for 36 floors and one was out for the whole 8 nights of our stay. Wait times were ok but can be extended in busy periods. Staff were friendly and room serviced daily by a lovely lady. 
My issue is all taxes and charges were paid to Airbnb except for the destination charge which was to be paid to the hotel. As checkout was busy express checkout was suggested with the invoice emailed. Upon receipt I had been charged the destination charge plus local taxes that had already been paid. No amount of phone calls to the hotel or Airbnb has reversed this mistake of US$308. Clearly both companies have no idea what their process is. Other reviews seems to replicate my experience. Don’t book on Airbnb is my advice.

We had security trying to get into our room aggressively one morning. They knocked multiple times, we told them ""not right now"" and they said they will come back later. We were still trying to sleep. They came back again and actually opened our door, we had a do not disturb sign on and we were in bed. They apologized and left. They came back again later, until I spoke to the front desk.
We were woken up every morning of our stay at about 9am to an announcement from the front desk repeating something like ""Attention, we will be conducting a test on the fire alarm system. If you see flashes or strobes, ignore them and stay in your room."" This repeated about 3x per announcement. It was very annoying, as we were here for a birthday trip and were out late at night but we would get woken up daily to this. The fridge in the room had trash left in it from the previous person staying in it. Overall, not very happy with the stay and wouldn't recommend.

This would have been a 5 star review if I wasn’t dealing with payment issues regarding improper charges two weeks after checking out.
The hotel was perfectly located and very convenient. The room was very comfortable and had everything we needed. The bathroom looked recently renovated and everything was cleaned daily. They stored our luggage after check out, which was really helpful.
Staff was friendly but did not help us after we were handed a report including excessive charges billed to my credit card that were not described here in this listing. I was expecting to pay the destination fee of $34.42 + $3.50 per night + refundable damage deposit, but instead we were charged double that price in unreasonable taxes and fees. I was told by the staff in the front desk that I should sort it out with the hosts from Airbnb, which I have been doing since we checked out but no resolution was offered so far. This was very disappointing and I wouldn’t trust this hotel again unfortunately.

Very good location. I was a little afraid of the noise but even being on the inner floors, the room was very quiet. The location is ideal for visiting the city on foot or very well served by the metro. 
Perfect room for one person, maybe a little small for two people with two suitcases.

Situated at Times Square location and near to subway stations for access. Easy to navigate subway. Take advantage of getting a “senior” metro card.  Subway much better to get around in Manhattan. Site location is excellent. Room was as shown in photo. Neat and clean but on the smaller side. Guard at front entrance makes for a good secure and safe entry. Reception area at an upper level. Reception staff pleasant and helpful.

It had smaller room that what was expected. No one serves you water for drinking, or making coffee in room. You need to get into the long line at the reception and get a small bottle of water which doesn't help for anything. 
Would recommend to plan some better arrangements for providing water to guests for coffee in odd hours.

If you just need a place to sleep, simple bathroom, and a great location, this place is perfect. If you’re looking for privacy and lots of amenities, this isn’t the best option. We had everything we needed and were thrilled with the location. The apartment is quiet and humble, quite tiny, but accurately presented in the listing.

The place was pretty much as expected; i was solo traveler for one night and was not sure how i would feel, but it felt secure once i got thru the initial process.  It is tight quarters but I knew that and did not need a ton of space.  The location was great and helped me have a quick visit.  The smart tv had more options than i expected and provided some comfort when in the room.  I was pleasantly surprised that in the shared space there was a fridge, stove burners, electric kettle, some plates, cups, utensils.  And it was reasonably quiet for mid town.  Thanks for providing an alternative to an expensive hotel further away."

For that location and price tag, the bedroom matched my expectation, but the bathroom was very clean and comfortable and exceeded my expectation. Check-in instructions were also very clear. My only complaint is that the hangers weren't clean enough, so we had to hang our clothes on the chair instead of in the wardrobe. But overall, comfortable and clean experience, and reasonable price tag."

Very easy to get in, the instructions with photos and automated door unlocking worked very well (tip: another guest logged first to wifi for the last door, to his room). Note that the address is the one in the instructions. Not sure why the one Airbnb lists is different. There is one bathroom for 3 rooms so be sure to get your shower early if you are in a rush and be mindful of others possibly waiting. 
The little kitchenette was great to toast my bread and make my tea.
The room was very small but very clean, the bed was comfortable. The only issue was the heat was very hot, coming up behind the bed. When I called for help it was suggested to either turn on the AC or open the window (or both). I'm a light sleeper and the AC kept walking me up on each new cycle. So I just opened wider the widow but kept being either hot or cold. If you sleep soundly this may not be an issue and the comforter may work well for you in a cool room."

Adam's place is definitely in a good location, which is Hell's Kitchen. The house is also clean, including the bathroom. Adam is very helpful and responsive. Two problems: The first is that the location is completely different from the one reported in the listing. I had booked Adam's place to stay near Mohyninan Station and go there with my (quite bulky) suitcases on foot. Instead, I found myself on a street 25 minutes away from the station. This is not okay. You never know who will book your place: it could be someone with mobility issues or someone in a hurry to get to the station. If you don't want to give the exact address of your home, that's fine, but at least report a place one or two streets away. 
The second point is space. The room is really small, even if it has everything. The bed is comfortable but it is bulky. It should be replaced with a smaller one to be able to at least get out of bed and have a minimum of extra space.

This is a good space for one person if you don't plan on staying at the Airbnb a good duration of your stay. There is many places you can go to in the area. It's very ideal if you're going to a convention at the Sheraton Hotel like I did. Keep in mind that the space is literally a bed room and there is not much space for more than just sleeping and sitting at a desk. Also, you share a kitchen space and bathroom space. This doesn't bother me, but for some who don't want to share a space then you would not like this space.  I would not suggest the space for anybody with any type of mobility restrictions. Otherwise, it's great if you literally just need a place to sleep. The hosts are very kind, welcoming and accommodating."

The apartment was very small but cozy with an excellent location it was very easy to move around the area there are many restaurants and tourist areas. 
The cleanliness was good and the place was quiet, the only thing that caught our attention and that made us not be able to rest is that through our bedroom there were some red tubes and they were very hot so the room was very hot, we put on the air conditioning and that helps a lot , but at night the noise and it cooled a lot , but if we took it off, it felt like boiling the room for the same thing that was small . 
I think those rich could be dangerous if one day they break and the heat they generate was the only thing we didn't like . Outside, everything was perfect

I loved my stay here with Johnny in NYC!  He was a great host, with a beautiful welcoming home, he provided awesome conversation, city recommendations and amenities in his home. Plus the bed and room were so comfortable, private, and quiet of street noises. As a solo traveler I immediately
felt safe in and around the home and neighborhood. Will hope to travel again to NYC and will be contacting him to stay again if I do. Thanks for an awesome weekend!"

John is a great host, happy to chat if you want, and give recommendations, but just as happy to give you space to do your own thing. After two days we felt we were staying with a friend. This is the only place we'll be staying if we go back to NYC."

There is so much to say about John. It can be a little scary staying in a place with a host and might feel awkward but John was absolutely amazing from the start and treated me with respect and made me feel right at home. He was always down for chatting while also giving me my space too. The bed and the private space was perfect and I’m so thankful for that. I travel to the city often so it’s nice to have a home away from home. I reccomend staying with him! I will again for sure."

We had a wonderful stay in Weehawken! The room was very clean, cozy, and exactly as described. The location is perfect — it only takes about 15 minutes by bus to get directly into New York City. The connections were excellent; it felt like buses were running at any time, which made getting around incredibly easy.
Alex was very helpful, always reachable, and made everything smooth for us. We felt well taken care of at all times.
A truly great place to stay for a New York visit — we would definitely come back and highly recommend this accommodation!"

Great views nearby overlooking the Hudson River , and great walks, lovely neighbourhood , but not much else to do in Weehawken. Great bus service to NYC so worth it.

Alex place is great for short-medium stays! The apartment is nice, clean, functional, and it is close to the bus stations (across the street or two block away) that take you to NY. The bathroom is super clean, the kitchen has things you might need to fix some meals. The room is simple but perfect for sleeping and rest after long days exploring the city. The apartment is shared but Alex allows you to have your full privacy. The street outside is a bit busy, but doesn’t bother me at all, conversely gives a lot of options of small groceries, restaurants and cafes nearby. In general, I really felt at home and I recommend this place without hesitation."

Alex is great and helpful. He recommended me some great local places and answered all my questions with explanations. 
The only disadvantage of this place is the location. For the first time in NYC, it was really hard to understand the bus system between NY and Weehawken. I took the wrong bus twice. So it's more disadvantage of the complicated transportation system than to Alex's place. 
But the view on Manhattan in NJ is worth seeing. So beautiful! 
Overall, it's a good, decent place for its money"

The stay was overall positive. The house was very clean, and the room was cozy, fully meeting our expectations.
Communication with the host was initially not optimal but improved over the course of our stay. At first, a comment about our origin left us somewhat puzzled, but the interaction became more cordial afterward.
A special thanks to Natalia, who was very kind and helpful, providing valuable assistance where Alex encountered some difficulties.

When I checked in at the accommodation, he carried my luggage, and he responded quickly to questions, so it was comfortable to stay.
Unlike the New York accommodation, the windows could be opened, so ventilation was possible and I was able to stay comfortably.
It took about 15 minutes to get to Manhattan, New York by nj transit bus. It took about 5 to 10 minutes on foot from the bus stop, so it was quite convenient to get around. (When I got off the bus, I was able to see the wonderful Manhattan view)
The accommodation was clean, and there was a wardrobe, so I had a comfortable stay.
Recommended for visiting Manhattan on a small budget.

There were really no downsides beside the place not being super close to downtown New York (but commute is easy and relatively fast). Its a very cosy, suburban and quiet location, ideal for people like me who also want to get away from the hustle and bustle of the big city at night. Thank you again for the hospitality!"

we stayed six nights for our first visit to NYC. The quick and frequent bus connection (less than half an hour to Times Square) was very comfortable.

The opportunity of using the kitchen especially for breakfast was another advantage. We would stay there again."

Wish we had breakfast at hotel. My only issue was we could smell smoking everywhere to include our room which was supposed to be smoke free. Room size was good considered all rooms In NYC will be small. Overall, we just had to get past the smoke to enjoy our stay."

While the room was smaller than expected, especially with the bed down, the experience improved significantly after we were moved. Our first room had some issues with the TV, bed, and a missing color wheel, but the new room on a higher floor offered amazing NYC views. The tv was as described on TikTok and the color wheel was amazing. The bed was very comfortable and warm for the winter days , and we liked having control over the thermostat and seeing the weather displayed. But other than that when we got everything the way we liked in our new room the price was good."

The location of Yotel is perfect to get around to anywhere you need to go in NY,NY. The room could use updating. The shower and toilet could have been cleaner. We sat to eat our food at a long table where people were just on the their computers not eating. We were told you could only sit there if you ate their cafe food.....no one else was even partaking in the restaurant. Felt a bit ridiculous for having spent $700 on a room. It was okay. Best thing was the location. The staff in lobby was great too."

We thoroughly enjoyed our 1 night “pre-cruise” stay. Super clean and comfortable. Staff was excellent. Room is very small and minimalistic yet functional. The bed frame is the adjustable kind which makes sense in the space…. Would work perfectly in a stateroom. 
Happy Family is an authentic Asian restaurant in walking distance. We also walked to Target, a diner for brunch and the dock with luggage… specifically Pier 88. 
Will def be back especially if porting out of Manhattan! They also offer “lay-over” stays. Which may come in handy when traveling for work."

Cons: No responses at all via Airbnb. Our thermostat was out so we weren’t able to adjust the temperature. There were fruit flies coming in from the tiny shower vent. The luggage storage was not free and was $3 per item. No access to water/ice on any of the floors except one but the water was brown - not drinkable.

I was mostly in town to see Broadway shows, and so the location was very convenient, as the M train takes you to Rockefeller Center. The front desk people were very nice. The breakfast is basic, but I was happy to get some fruit and a bagel in the morning. I highly recommend this place but don’t want it to get too too popular because then the prices will go away up!"

Place was as advertised and clean. The area is not great and walls seem pretty thin. Wind and outdoor noise can be heard very loud in room. Aside from those couple drawbacks the stay was good and is conveniently located a couple minutes walk from the subway.

Great visit, it had exactly what we were looking for a 1 night stay. The unit is spacious and modern. Having a mini fridge is always a plus. Love that you can go downstairs for breakfast and you can also buy snacks and drinks downstairs if needed. What could have been better were that there were a few stains on multiple towels that we did not use yet. Also the TV did not work as intended.

The hotel is really cute and clean the hot water pressure and the hot water are amazing. That’s a big plus for me. The rooms were immaculate. The staff was very friendly. Check-in was easy, your 2 1/2 blocks away from the subway train which is very convenient you are not close to anything walkable with restaurants or food, but I had planned on going into the city so I would definitely stay again. The bed was amazing.  During the day there is  the hustle and bustle of New York City on the outside but at night it’s very quiet so we got a lot of rest. We enjoyed our stay. Friendly hosts quick to respond."

At first I was speculative about the neighborhood. Once we ventured out and began taking the subway living like a local we realized how peaceful it actually was. How may others staying in close by neighborhoods were doing the same. Can’t experience New York if you don’t travel like them. Breakfast was served every morning and flexible. Although it was a very limited variety you could still be sure you ate your fill. Fresh towels and house keeping was very polite and trustworthy. We forgot a bag and had made it to Nashville already and received a call that we had left it. Would definitely stay there again

Stay was good and hotel itself was nice. Room was clean and comfortable. The area isn’t the nicest though. Was a bit sketchy at night as a solo female traveler. My only complaint about hotel itself is that my room was right next to the cleaning/staff room. They were very loud talking and moving stuff super early in the morning and woke me up a few times. It was very annoying and I’d request a different room away from their station if I stayed here again.

Issue with my stay. Wouldn’t advise staying here. I was repeatedly given conflicting information by the staff, which made the experience frustrating and confusing.

Bathroom is clean and nice.  
The location is great, you’re super close to the station and it’s truly ideal. I think a lot of the comments about the location are snobbish. There is a children’s school right around the corner, it is a safe area. I have a feeling what’s making some people uncomfortable is the color of the neighborhood and the clear lack of money being implemented to update more of the area (without inconveniencing the current residents) 
Wifi is really bad and I kept getting cut off during an important meeting.
Unfortunately, although most of the staff was fine, a younger employee (we were told his name is Matthew?) was extremely rude. He consistently ignored me when I went down to ask for help and then again when I asked for assistance purchasing an item from their shop.

My friend and i stopped at this hotel for 1 night.The room was good,spacious and clean.The hotel location was very convenient,it took us only 20min to get to Manhattan by subway.The staff was friendly and the neighborhood seemed fine,like a regular big city neighborhood. We did have few issues though. At the moment of reservation I made sure to ask about the bed size(in the designation it was advertised as king size bed),I was reassured the bed is king size.When we arrived we realized the bed was queen size.When i asked the front desk about it,they told me ""all our beds are queen size,you have a king size room"".Interesting wording.Another thing- the most important thing for me is parking.Again,the hotel advertised they do have parking available on the premises with another Interesting wording for that.And to be fair,they do have parking, but it's only 7-8 spots right in front of the building.We were lucky enough to have 1 free spot and leave our car there.I guess it's NewYork.

Not today we are all sold out? Get to the room, temp 72, cannot adjust thermostat, TV does not work, and placed in handicapped while water leaked all over the restroom floor.

Excellent price, close to a metro stop and 2 or 3 stops from Manhattan, the included breakfast buffet can save you a lot of money. We ordered a lot of packages from Amazon and they all arrived without a problem. The front desk is responsible for receiving packages regardless of whether you are in the hotel.
The room and cleanliness are a total luxury for the price. I would come back!

I had a great stay at Monica’s place this week. The room was perfect—comfortable and just a short 15-minute walk to the Javits Center and Times Square. I even randomly came across the red carpet premiere for the F1 movie in Times Square, which was a cool surprise!
Monica’s cat was super friendly and would greet me every time I came back. On my last day, it was even hanging out by my window.
If you’re looking for a simple, affordable spot close to a lot of NYC sights, I’d definitely recommend staying here.

I had such a wonderful time at Monica's.
. I really loved the bed, especially after many hours on the flight, that comfortable bed was really needed.
I was very well received by Monica and Dracula whom we just connected instantly!!!
Monica was so welcoming and supportive. Her place is in a very good location and easy to locate. 
what touched me most was when she agreed to keep my luggage after check out!!.. I was so touched because it's rare to find understanding hosts...
Thank you so much Monica, I had such a great time and I will sure be back!!!"

I stayed at Monica’s Airbnb for 11 nights and had a wonderful time in New York. The room was charming and perfect for a longer stay – especially with the lovely company of Monica’s sweet and friendly cat. The shared bathroom was cleaned daily, and the entire apartment felt very clean and well-maintained. Although there is a club nearby, I never found the music to be loud or disturbing – I didn’t even need the earplugs that were provided. As a solo female traveler, I found the neighborhood to be absolutely safe and comfortable – I always felt at ease. Monica was a very kind and helpful host. I can warmly recommend this place to anyone!"

It is located 10-15 minutes from the center of Times Square, so it is accessible.
The room was tidy, the bed was fluffy, and the blankets were clean, so I was able to sleep comfortably.
There's a little breeze through the window, but if you close the curtains and turn on the fan, it's warm.
The cat is also completely cute. I had a good time for a week!

Hell's Kitchen Launchpad-- I stayed 3 nights in the private room (lockable door) inside Monica's second story apartment. She was flexible and let me drop off my bags several hours before official check in time. She buzzed me in and hand delivered the keys I'd need and made sure I knew what went where etc. Bed and pillows etc were very comfortable (not cheap).  Monica is available but not lurking--if you need her, she's there but otherwise you probably won't see her, even though there's a shared bathroom. Her cat Dracula is a clear bonus...he's happy to meet you in the morning and have some scritches.  As for the location...you're in a typical Manhattan neighborhood, which means you're not far from wherever you want to go. The 50th St subway station is a comfortable 8-ish minute walk. Tons of restaurants in the immediate area. Very comfortable property for one traveler. Highly recommended."

It's an excellent location, with easy access to public transportation, and lots of shops and restaurants right below you on the street level. We loved that there was a coffee shop on either side of the building entrance! No shortage of morning caffeination!
Paula is a delightful person and made sure we had everything we needed for our stay. She was very responsive to communication and gave detailed instructions. Thanks for everything, Paula! Happy Holidays!"

The location was AMAZING!!!!! Just a few blocks from Times Square, Central Park, all Broadway shows, and a MTA station was around the corner. The room & bathroom were extremely clean, and the apartment as a whole was HUGE by NYC standards. Obviously you're sharing the space with Paula, so you'll probably see/hear her in the kitchen or living room. The ONLY thing that posed an issue was the front door key; it was extremely touchy & very difficult to unlock the front door."

From the moment we arrived the doorman made us feel so welcome. The beds and bedding were so comfortable, the kitchen was completely clean and stocked with whatever we needed. The bathrooms were impeccable. The terrace/deck was so comfortable and the views were indescribable. Walked to the subway was maybe a 6 minute walk through the vibrant neighborhood. We always felt safe and welcomed. The restaurants and bodegas were so delicious. We only ate in the neighborhood except for a hot dog in Central Park and pizza. I would definitely recommend this apartment to everyone and if I get another chance to visit New York I will definitely stay here again. The sanctuary of the apartment let us enjoy the go go go of New York with sightseeing and Broadway shows and we felt so comfortable and relaxed in our down time at the apartment. ⭐️ ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"

Lotus is very nice and friendly. However,  my stay was ruined by no hot water. I discovered it on day 2. Host was apparently unaware. It was never fixed. cold showers in winter is unacceptable. had to check out 2 days early.  also, kitchen was too cluttered for cooking etc. no coffee maker or toaster. location is convenient as far as Harlem, but I was surprised by the prevalence of drug addicts and vagrants in the immediate vicinity. I did get refunded, thankfully.
Response from Lotus
January 2026
Thank you, Jukka, for your feedback and for noting my friendliness as a host.
Regarding the hot water, I was not aware of the issue until it was reported during your stay. Once notified, the building superintendent addressed the water heater and the issue was resolved. Airbnb reviewed the situation and processed a refund in accordance with their policy.
I live in the home and cook regularly, so the kitchen is an actively used, lived-in space. It is kept clean and fully functional, and it is equipped for guests for light cooking, including a gas stove and microwave, as described in the listing. A French press is also available for coffee.
The listing clearly states the location in Central Harlem. As with many areas of New York City, it is an urban neighborhood with a wide range of realities, which may differ from individual expectations.
Thank you for your stay, and I wish you well in your future travels."

Lotus’s home is stunning, has so much character and is very clean and safe. The area can get noisy but you don’t hear it all from inside. For me the location is the only thing, her place is lovely and safe but the location doesn’t give that same vibe yk. But the good news is the subway is literally 1 min walk from her place as well as the shopping plaza and beautiful cafes. Central Park is also a 10 min walk from her place as well, so that’s refreshing. Lotus truly was an amazing host, making sure the heater was constantly running, the bed was the most comfortable bed I’ve slept in, the place was spotless, she made me feel very welcome and safe, and enhanced my experience in NYC!"

Lotus is a warm and welcoming host who prioritizes ease for her guests. The room is absolutely lovely, spacious, and comfy - the private bathroom is also spacious and was very clean. This is NYC so there are narrow stairs to consider, but if you don’t have any mobility issues, I honestly don’t know why you wouldn’t stay here. The location is great because you’re right by the 2/3 line and can get anywhere fairly easily, if that’s an important consideration for you. Highly recommend The Red Rooster which is just up the street with their jazz and gospel brunches! Plus I had such good conversation with Lotus … the next time I’m in the city I’ll definitely be staying here. This is a great spot for female solo travelers. Thank you, Lotus. 🫶🏼"

The listing is close to the subway so it was really easy and accessible to get around Manhattan. I would definitely come back. 
Thank you for making my solo trip so memorable. ❤️"

Staying at Lotus's was such a wonderful experience. It didn't just feel like a place to sleep, but a home away from home. 
Amenities-wise and logistically speaking, I very much appreciated the pristine conditions of the place, the convenient location (a very short walk from the metro), and the very comfortable room. Staying at Lotus's helped me feel very much at ease.
Further, it was great to get to interact with Lotus herself. On top of the necessary discussions about the logistics of my stay, it was wonderful to get to know Lotus on a more personal basis, and to feel like an actual home guest. This felt especially great for me, given that I was travelling solo.
Highly, highly recommended!"

Although, the 4th floor with no elevator is something to keep in mind since the staircases are narrow, it was quite a struggle to get my 40-50 pound suitcase up.

Great place with an amazing location. The only issue is the noise — the window doesn’t close all the way due to airflow, so you might hear people loading and unloading from trucks at night. 
Other than that, Adrian is very supportive and open to negotiation. Overall, if you’re on a solo trip, this place is almost the perfect home for you in New York! — just bring some earplugs

Location is great, the room is lovely :) only tricky part for me was getting up all the stairs with my suitcase but only because I’m 5 months pregnant! Also, I didn’t realise that weed is legal in NY, and there was a strong smell of it in part of the apartment which made me a bit worried being preggers. More a heads up for anyone visiting NYC! 
I loved the access system of getting into the stay, it felt really safe! Having air con was a huge help too!

But, Jeffery was really kind to help and guide us with everything. The bed was SOOO soft it was so hard for me to get up at times 🤣 Anyways, Jeffery really felt like having a chill dad who would check in on us once in a while. He also gossiped with me every night (I always looked forward to that part of the night). If I could go back right now to stay for another week, I would. Thank you Jeffery!"

Our stay with Jeffery was well spent! My boyfriend and I don’t have a negative thing to say. Jeffery was extremely kind and responsive even before we checked in. The place was clean with all the amenities we needed for a 4-night stay. The location was also great for us as we used the subway, which had a stop only a couple blocks away, and drove as we could easily get on the FDR/Westside highway. Another highlight for us was that though it was a shared space, we felt welcomed, comfortable, and that we were granted our privacy throughout our stay. Highly recommend this place for single or double travelers! Thanks again Jeffery!"

Jeffrey does a great job of having lovely conversations with you when you want them and respecting your privacy, always. We were a chatty couple so we got to debrief our days with him (and hear about his days) every day of the trip. His apartment is beautiful and has so much character.
He even surprised us with a cherry cake he had made and offered us a piece! So yummy."

Jeffrey was one of the best hosts I’ve ever had on Airbnb. I very much enjoyed our chats about Theatre, which we both work in. When I needed laundry done, he very kindly did it. He kept all areas of the accommodation very tidy. I especially enjoyed his piano playing (divine) and his bathtub! I have a sensitivity to scented laundry detergent and he was responsive to my request to change the sheets. 
The one drawback was there wasn’t a proper table to sit down and eat my meals and work. He converts his living/dining room into his bedroom when guests stay, so the dining table wasn’t available. I adapted one of the small side tables in the bedroom to function as an eating area, so there is that option, along with a luggage rack with a removable countertop, which was too low for me. Otherwise, I had a great stay."

My mother and I had a great stay at Jeffrey's place! He is an extremely responsive, helpful, intelligent, and friendly host! He is also a colleague musician - we enjoyed very much conversing with him on various topics, and he was very kind to let me play on his piano.
Jeffrey's place has our highest recommendations: it is very clean, has all necessary amenities, and the room is very comfortable, quiet, and easily hosts 2 people. The area is quite nice - conveniently close to the subway, in a good neighborhood, and with good restaurant choices and shopping locations.  The apartment has everything that one might need; there is also an elevator in the hallway. My mother is extremely picky when it comes to travelling, and Jeffrey's place ticks all the boxes for her - which is why, in fact, this was a repeat visit for us (the last one of 5!).
This is a great value for the price - and we couldn't recommend it more strongly for anyone visiting or looking to do business in NY!"

Jeff was a super responsive and helpful host who was always available. The apartment itself was great. Only note is that the listing shows a living room with a piano, etc. This room was not accessible to us as guests and it was where Jeff stayed while we were in the only bedroom. He has a curtain separating the room from shared spaces, but that’s it. This was somewhat of a disappointment as the listing did not explicitly state that this area would not be accessible. It might be good to clarify that in the listing."

Very happy with my stay at Daniela’s!! The building was charming and I felt like I was getting an authentic NYC experience. The train being a five minute walk, it was easy and cheap to explore several parts of the city. Although it was freezing outside when we visited, the apartment was a warm and cozy oasis. We had everything we needed and more and I felt right at home :) my partner was worried about staying in a shared space, but we didn’t even see the other guests and they were respectful of the space. We did meet Daniela, who is absolutely lovely. I would definitely stay here again and I recommend it to anyone!"

We appreciated the hospitality of the host who was above and beyond with cleanliness and organization in the apartment. The bed was very comfortable, there were lots of storage places and the kitchen was well stocked. The instructions were clearly communicated to us. Furthermore, the host was always prompt in answering questions or concerns. The Flushing 7 line was a 5 minute walk and the neighborhood had all essential amenities.

It's so wonderful to have a host who knows all the best places in the city.  We are already planning our next stay at Niko's."

Since New York is quite expensive, being able to cook inside really helped us save money as well.
Thank you so much, and we sincerely hope to meet again on another occasion.

The listing and location were great. The bedroom was comfortable, and the shared spaces were clean. It's conveniently located near the subway and restaurants, plus many tourist attractions.
However, my experience with the host was unsettling. The first two nights were fine, but on the third day, he repeatedly asked about my checkout time. On my last day, he barged into my room at 7:45 am, terrifying me; I had to block the door with a chair. He seemed surprised when I reminded him it was not even 8am yet. He only apologized after I expressed my discomfort. He offered a Paris baguette bag, but it was filled with trash.
He mentioned partying one of the nights I was there. On check-in day, he offered early access but ignored my calls until he finally woke up and gave me a one day rebate, which I appreciated. 
Disregarding the check-in mishap, I'm shocked by this experience given his prior ratings. I wouldn’t recommend this place for those valuing safety and privacy.
Response from Niko

I have never opened the door on a guest at anytime ever before. However, in this case, I am fully responsible. I had taken a new medication that interfered greatly with one I have been taking for 30 years. The side effects were extreme I am sorry for how it effected you and your stay. Needless to say the new medication has been unprescribed and is no more. Therefore, this intrusion will never happen to anyone ever again. My heartfelt apology and and I ask for your forgiveness."

Location and price was also amazing. EVERYTHING was close by, either by walk or city transportation. As long as you go into the stay with the mindset that this is a place to sleep and shower, you'll be really happy. Niko's place has everything you need to be comfortable!!!

We could also use Niko's kitchen to boil water. You know how important hot water is to Chinese people😊😊😊. Although Airbnb says that the kitchen is not shared, Niko warmly allowed me to use it after I asked. He also introduced us to popular local restaurants.Hope to have the opportunity to return to the United States and stay again.By the way, Niko's little pet, Midnight, and her little buddy are so cute

My man, Shae! In 12 years this is the first one word review and I love it!! I am cracking up. I am not being sarcastic (and thank you for the 5 stars in everything else) I was always wondering when someone will just type one word because I have to review everyone and finding words can be difficult and annoying. I have always wished -- why cant I leave just one word! I'm still laughing. You are great! Thanks man."

Nikko is a friendly and welcoming host. He’s helpful and flexible. The location is ideal for exploring the Westside of Manhattan. Walking distance to theaters, restaurants, subway, bodega-like stores for quick breakfast or late night snacks, and MOMA. These benefits far out way the smaller size room - the apartment is in a typical Manhattan walk up. It worked well for me during my 4 night stay."

Returning guests who love the  place and the host.  Niko welcomed us back as if we were old friends.  Everything is so comfortable: the bed, the pillows, the lighting.  We slept so well after a day of Chinatown, Little Italy and MJ the musical. We were well rested for our 2nd day which was 2 more plays and a 50th year SNL experience.  We had a metro card but barely used it. Everything was so close.  
We are coming back as soon as we can!

It's comforting to have the ear of a NYC veteran to bounce ideas off of or get recommendations from. We just adore him and his cozy space....and of course his guinea pigs add to the charm. Would recommend.

Niko's place is super central and a great place to base yourself while checking out NYC day and night. Not big but nonetheless an oasis to wrap-up a full day out and somewhere to rest and relax, shower, sleep, before setting out the next day again. It is comfortable, clean, and thoughtfully laid out given the small space."

The location is so good because it's near Central Park, but the smell of guinea pigs was so bad that it was hard to get into the house. Fortunately, the room I stayed in didn't smell like guinea pigs. There is no elevator, so it is very difficult for people with a lot of luggage. The stairs are steep.

Great experience! Ask for Richie at the bar. He gave us so many great recommendations. 
The room is very small; as with any thing in NYC, but furnished perfectly with everything you need! 
My only complaint is their elevators…take forever to get one bc there’s only 4 and they run slow. Keep that in mind if you’re on a schedule. 
I would definitely stay again! Great location!

Great spot and as advertised.  Clean and very friendly staff.  Room is a bit “cozy” but that’s to be expected in Manhattan.  Same for the price being a bit steep but really a fairly good deal relative to other options close by during the holidays.  It’s close to Times Square so expect some noise.  Get a higher floor if possible to help with that.  Definitely would stay here again.

It was really fun to have a drink at the rooftop with NYC happening down below, we were extremely close to everything we wanted to do with easy access. The hosts were amazing and very responsive as we did have some confusion with the parking lot associated with the hotel initially but the hosts got it figured out for us. We will 100 percent be back when we come back to NYC and can’t wait to return. Thanks for a great stay!

We had a wedding in the city and instead of using a traditional booking method we tried through Airbnb. I was a little hesitant because it was my first time booking a hotel through Airbnb, but I am happily surprised of how easy it was and a bit cheaper as well.
The hotel was in the heart of Times Square so the location was perfect for everywhere we needed to go. Everyone who worked there was very kind and friendly. The room was pretty spacious for an NYC room. I was excited to use the all year round pool, but unfortunately, there was a event that weekend and it snowed so it was too icy the following day but totally understandable and didn’t ruin the trip at all.
If we didn’t have the wedding, we wouldn’t have left hotel because there was just so much to do within it. Bars, restaurants, by the way totally check out the rooftop bar! Communication was easy and we would definitely stay here again!!

I loved the location. Room was small, but the decorations were really cute and made you feel at home. The bed is super comfortable. Probably one of the more comfortable beds I’ve ever slept on while traveling. 
It’s right in the heart of Times Square and also offers full time security staff so you feel safe at all times. 
Will definitely book here again next time

We had a great stay at Margaritaville! It is right in the middle of the hustle and bustle of Times Square with easy access to the train. The rooms were beautiful and felt brand new. Check in took three minutes and they even managed to give us an upgraded corner room which we very much appreciated! Would absolutely stay here again!

We arrived at the Margaritaville Resort in Times Square around 7:30pm. We were able to find the front desk no issue. The employees at the resort were incredibly kind. Despite the hosts Jason and Lizzy confirming our reservation a few days earlier, saying they were “excited for our stay”, the hotel had no record of our reservation. They checked under every name. We attempted to contact the hosts to see if it was under a name or if they could help resolve this. We did not hear from them at all and were left with no place to stay in the city since the resort was sold out. 
Thankfully Airbnb was able to refund us and we were able to sleep a few blocks down at another hotel. The employees at the resort were more than accommodating and I would gladly book a stay at the resort in the future. However I will never be booking hotel stays through Airbnb again. Thanks for nothing Jason and Lizzy.

We looked at a lot of different hotels and decided on Margaritaville due to location and reputation. It was fantastic!  The rooms were cute and spotless. We had a great view of the pool and city. We had a Keurig coffee maker in our in room and the rooftop bar had amazing drinks, food and view!  All of the staff were so friendly and very proactive in letting us know when our room was ready for check in. Would definitely stay again.  Also, it’s helpful to bring a sound machine due for those of us not used to “the big city”!  😉

We found Margaritaville and couldn’t be happier with everything about our stay. Check in was easy (and in fact we arrived early and were able to get into our room early), hotel staff couldn’t have been nicer, the room was small but absolutely adorable and very clean, and we had a great view. Great experience and I can’t wait to come back.

We are so pleased with our stay. The staff was friendly and  helpful. One night, specifically, we were trying to go to the Rooftop Bar, but the button on the elevator was being finicky. A staff member immediately assisted us. He was patient, diligent, and kind. 
We had incredibly busy days while in NYC. We left at 7:00 AM and often didn’t return until that evening. It was so nice to walk into a clean room each day. We never wanted for clean towels or clean sheets! They also provided fresh water and coffee each day. We felt right at home. 
We will be staying here again. I can’t say enough great things about this place, and the views are top tier! 
While I’m glad to be home, I will miss this place. Until next time! 🗽🍎🤍

As first time visitors to NYC, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Margaritaville Times Square. Tons of day/night life very close by but just far enough away to still feel like a peaceful escape. Security on duty by the entrance made the stay feel very safe at all times, and they did not hesitate to turn non visitors away after closing hours. Staff members were very nice and accommodating with anything we needed, house keeping kept our room well stocked/clean and we especially appreciated the luggage storage accommodations before & after our check out. Zero complaints, would certainly stay here again.

Exactly what I was looking for in hotel! Perfect location next to broadway shows and time square. Tons of things to do near the resort. Also it was centrally located in the city to easily travel around to see the surroundings. Gorgeous roof top bar/restaurant with stunning views of the city that you don’t want to miss!Absolutely friendly and helpful staff! Housekeeping was the best, keeping us stocked with water/coffee and keeping our room immaculate!!!
Only negative was the Margaritaville restaurant. Good food but very time consuming-hard to get in and hard to get food/drinks since they were busy and understaffed. Dinner on a Saturday at 4pm took 2 hrs for our meal (for 2 people) and we ended up just asking for our ticket and leaving after waiting 45 mins on our second round of drinks that never came.
Still with all of this said, I would definitely stay again ♥️

At the end of the day, it was a place to sleep. It is in the middle of the hustle and bustle of Times Square which was convenient for getting around to broadway shows. The cleanliness of the room was questionable considering there were hand prints on the windows. The front desk staff were very nice. Would I stay there again? Probably not but the experience was unforgettable. Thanks Margaritaville

We loved the location. Service at the hotel was very good! The room was small, but comfortable. It would have been nice to have at least a desk chair with a back for a place to sit.
The base of the bed caused many stubbed toes and shins. It would be nice if something could be done to prevent that!
Overall it was great and we will be back!

It’s unclear from the listing how heavily Jimmy Buffet themed the place is. The decor, music in the elevator, colors, etc are a bit much if you’re not expecting it. The location is in a super busy area but very quiet in the rooms. The rooms are small but well furnished and very clean. It’s crazy expensive for what you get but seems to be on par with nyc hotels.

Great location in Times Square, and clean rooms. Only note is the “self parking” option is not self parking in a traditional, it is still valet parking but without the option of getting your car in and out throughout the day. That was confusing for us. Besides that though, staff was friendly and having multiple bars/restaurants on site is a great touch for the resort feel downtown NYC.

Had a great stay at Margaritaville! It’s central and walking distance to everything! The only downfall we had was the elevators. They only had 3 elevators working for the entire hotel, be prepared to wait 15 + mins to get on one especially during the peak hours! Make sure to allocate time for the elevators if you’re planning on going somewhere because we were almost late to our reservations we had. The elevators were an absolute nightmare here

The neighborhood gets sketchy though, especially if you’re a solo traveler (even more as a woman), thankfully nothing happened to me, but i was cautious. The subway is indeed really close to the place and it takes u to manhattan in less than 20 min. To sum up, the place is really practical if you’re planning on visiting nyc, just be aware at night."

On my 3-day trip to New York, I stayed at Trenton's house. The house was located in Harlem, very close to the subway. I didn't have any transportation problems. It's on the 6th floor of a building without an elevator, but that wasn't a problem for me. Trenton was a good host. This house was a perfect price performance accommodation for me. I highly recommend ☺️ (note: those who are very sensitive to sound may be a little disturbed because the train passes very close but it is not a big problem)"

Trenton is very friendly. I felt guilty that I didn’t get the chance to have a proper conversation. Until the last hour where Trenton kindly let me check out late while I waited for my Lyft. 
This place does exactly what it says on the tin! If you want High Society living in New York, Harlem is not the place. This is a real neighbourhood though and as long as you keep your head down it is perfectly safe. 
Trenton’s place is perfect for a single traveller looking for a cheap stay and just wants a bed and bathroom. 
Very responsive and helpful on check-in. I think it was almost 1am by the time I arrived and I was shattered. He was perfectly happy for me to go straight to my room, even helping with my luggage!
I think I am done with New York, this was my 3rd visit. But if I do I would definitely look to book Trenton again!

I was hesitant to book this room because I thought it was strange to book a hotel room through Airbnb, but it worked out fine! The room was messy (some hair and mold in the bathroom, bed unmade when we arrived) but if you’re just looking for a place to sleep and don’t plan on spending much time in the room while visiting NY, it’ll do the job. It was a great deal, so I’d stay again for a short trip.

I feel like we lucked out with this stay! When looking for a hotel I was seeing extremely high prices, until I came along this gem. A good location with super simple check in. In fact we were actually able to check in several hours early which was so helpful! A very responsive host as well.. only complaint is the conditioner bottle in the shower was empty. Would highly recommend!

No real complaints. Clean hotel, easy access to subway, kind employees. We did not partake in the continental breakfast so I cannot speak to that. Neighborhood seemed fine.

Location was perfect close to many attractions and restaurants. Staff was quick to respond to any issues we had (like lack of hot water, toiletries). One major set back was elevator service, specially during morning breakfast as they only had two and at times only one was working. One day my boyfriend went up the stairs (to 21st floor) since he had waited over 20 minutes during breakfast. This is not ideal for anyone!

I would not stay here again. although the location was great and the price not too unreasonable, we were given a room with two full beds when we booked a king and nobody could remedy it for us. further, one of the bed sheets had a hole the size of a doorknob in it and we had to ask for a hair dryer and coffee pods because they were not provided.  last, the elevator service was so poor that there were often patrons lined up waiting for several elevator runs before they could board.

The accommodations were clean and adequate but not very fancy. The bathroom shower was small and in need of some minor fixes. 
The free breakfast was very good and the staff was friendly.
One of the elevators kept breaking down and since there were only two that meant a long wait at times which wasn’t as big a deal for us on the 5th floor but a big problem for those above us. 
However, the location was great. We could walk to everything and for the price relative to other hotels in the area it was what you would expect

Really good host very responsive, free breakfast which included pancakes, bagels, eggs, sausages etc. 
The only thing was the cleanliness of the room and the hotel itself. The bathroom could do with a little refurb as there was bits of wall crumbing. 
There is also only 2 lifts in the hotel which can get extremely busy meaning you might have to use the stairs instead as we ended up waiting 10min for a space in the lift.

The location was good , convenient, close to entertainments. The room was clean and comfy. Breakfast was simple but available. I would advise to go earlier because it got very busy close to 8:00 am. My only thing I didn’t like was very busy elevators and you have to stay in line to get to your floor. Otherwise my stay was pleasant .

Location was as expected & good for our purposes. Staff were pleasant. 
Perhaps some of what I was disappointed in was listed (very small room & no log in access to streaming on tv) but other aspects of room & hotel were dissatisfying: shower was moldy & the drain cover was missing, very small elevators causing very long waits to use, breakfast was chaotic so we didn’t take advantage of it, hallways & stairwell were not clean.

Great place. Close to Times Square and many food options available including quick food and sit down options, we stayed one day and a night, very clean and comfortable. The only downside I was a little disappointed when I learned that we couldn’t make the waffles ourselves. Normally that decision wouldn’t bother me but the lady who was making them was cleaning and walking around at the same time which I appreciate bc she’s keeping it clean but she was wearing a mask that wasn’t coving her nose and she repeatedly coughed into her ungloved hand and didn’t sanitize them before taking the food off the burner. That absolutely canceled the point of the mask and the point of not having hundreds of hands touching the maker.

I gave this 4 stars only because it didnt include a microeave in the room and a place to wash clothes. However theres a microwave downstairs and a laundrymat a block away. The room was clean and matched the description, my host kept in contact with me throughout the trip. The free breakfast is one of the best parts of the trip, NY food can be expensive and this helps with the prices a little by providing you a big breakfast. A thing to keep in mind is this hotel is in times square but if your thinking about the main plaza like one times sqaure, your going to have to walk a couple blocks. If you able bodied its not that bad of a walk and there are lots of things close by like broadway. I recommend getting this hotel.

The Hampton is located just a block or so off Times Square. This made getting around New York as easy as it can be. The staff were always friendly and the room was tidy and cleaned daily during my stay. You could tell my particular room had sustained water damage and some point and has never been properly repaired. The entire room sloped towards the outside of the building so much so that the shower pan wouldn’t drain correctly and the door on the wardrobe wouldn’t stay open. The TV was also very dated and the cable cut in and out frequently. If you want a room that’s convenient it is that, otherwise it’s not worth the price as they do not do any repairs or updates with the amenities.

Overall, the hotel was moderately clean and the staff were professional and kind. However, there were several issues that made the stay frustrating.
There were only two elevators in the entire hotel for both guests and staff, which caused long delays. We stayed on the 15th floor and ended up walking down all 15 flights of stairs with our luggage so we wouldn’t miss our flight. We called the elevator three times, and each time the wait was at least 5 to 10 minutes, and the elevators were completely full.
While the hotel was affordable, I would not stay here again. The room temperature was also very uncomfortable, constantly switching between unbearably hot and unbearably cold.

Dirty rugs, noisy place, mirrors disfigured, bed linens with black lint throughout, safe didn't work (wouldn't lock), no cookies at 3 pm - 5pm as promised, dirty elevators. TV not programed with time nor date.
The owners need to remodel, do upgrades. I know this is a busy Hampton Inn due to the location of Times Square, but you can do remodeling  floor by floor until completed.  Only lose a few bucks spread out over time and happier guests. I've owned 2 businesses and this is not the ideal way to satisfy a guest/client.
I will never stay here again; not up to my cleanliness standards.
Highlights: The breakfast guy is helpful and cheery housekeeping did an great job. Check in & out easy.

From out side looking up at our room, it appeared there were only a few rooms that had our issue possibly. The curtain mount itself didn’t allow for it to close and the apartments directly across from us could see right in. Also the only ice machine that worked was in the basement.

On top of that, at check-in I was told there would be a $150 fee held until check-out and that it would be refunded instantly. However, when I checked out, I was informed that it actually takes five business days for the money to be returned. This is nothing but lies and complete disregard for the guest.

After waiting to get checked in we missed our tour and it was my birthday so it was ruined. The host took a while to respond while dealing with this. There were people everywhere waiting on their room to be cleaned. Once we got our room the mirror had some kind of symbols written on them and they never came to clean it or remove it. The shower floor was missing and hard to stand on. Host was bad and hotel was as well. Now the location is the only thing that was good about it all.

Dear Tasha, thank you for sharing your feedback. I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience you experienced during your birthday stay.

We were on a two day mother/son trip to New York. We saw four shows and walked to Central Park and Times Square. Our stay was exactly what we needed. The hotel was clean and safe and the location could not have been better. We easily walked from the train station to the hotel to drop our bags. The staff were amazing. They were very nice and helpful and kept our bags before we checked in and after we checked out so we did not have to try to drag them through theatres.  It was just a great stay. Thank you!

I didn't actually get to stay at this hotel. When I arrived, they said they had no rooms and took me to a hostel two doors down. The service was excellent, but then the new hostel overcharged my credit card without informing me. I asked the front desk about it after I noticed that I was being charged for extra cost, and they said it was a mistake and they would refund the money. But I still feel bad.

Dear Mingyu, I am deeply sorry to hear about your experience. It is certainly not the standard we uphold.

Please be assured that Management will address these concerns to prevent recurrence. Thank you for bringing this to our attention."

This was an extra night we had to do, so we had to schedule the extra night through here, but here is the review again:
Location was perfect! You are just a block away from the street that will take you directly to times square, also you have one of the main subway stations just a couple of blocks away and everything seems super close.
Staff is superfriendly on main desk, on breakfast, cleaning; all of them were super helpful and great; We had to stay an extra night due to a winter storm and they were super helpful to make sure we didn't have any extra inconvenience.
Internet is not that great but I managed to have some calls and work a bit from the hotel.
Only real drawback we really had was about the elevators. One broke down on the second day so you have to wait a long time to go either up or down during peak hours, and it wasn't fixed in the full 7 extra days we stayed there.

Had a great stay at this location. central for all that NYC has to offer and short walk from times square. Beds are very comfy and rooms are clean and cozy, but the place is very dated. Not worth the price we paid.
I have to say that although the guy at breakfast was really nice and cheerful, the breakfast experience was not the best. We were unable to have breakfast on 2 of the days, due to there being to many people and not enough seating. people were taking there food to the rooms if and when they could get to the food. The lifts were broken throughout our stay, with only one lift working. My family had to drag their cases down 7 flights of stairs when we were checking out as the lift that was working was full for over 1 hour so difficult to get in with the amount of people using them. it was stressful. People corrugated outside the lift and the space was only wide enough for one person, made it difficult to assess. Staff were lovely, friendly and professional. made to feel welcome.

While I was very stressed out over the hotel not having our correct reservation due to rebooking issues (I was reassured after my partner informed me people could own hotel rooms in New York 😅), eventually the reservation was put in place successfully and we were able to check in with no problem. Traveling can be really stressful and the hosts were communicative and helpful, especially when I was very stressed over our booking. 
The location is in a wonderful area, reasonable distance between all sight seeing and nearby transportations. There’s a 20.00 shuttle from the airport to a ten minute walk from the hotel. Thank you to the hosts for their patience and ensuring my reservation was in placed through my travel panic, the stay once the reservation was in place was smooth and wonderful!

Nice location, small but cozy room, friendly and helpful staff, I would have given a 5-star review if it were not for what we experienced during the first night.
During the stay of our first night, the heating system in the room did not work. The room was too cold to fall asleep in NYC's freezing December. At around 5:00 a.m., I went to the front desk and reported the issue. Later, an engineer confirmed that the heat had broken. We were then transferred to another room.
After the transfer, I noticed that there was a clearly installed control panel on the wall for the heating system, while there were only exposed screws at the same place in the previous room. This indicated that the hotel should have already known the failure of the amenity, but they still assigned the room to me.
I requested a refund for the first night. So far, the hotel hasn't responded, even after the intervention of Airbnb. 
Anyway, this might be a good place most of the time, but be aware of the risk.

Great hotel, great and friendly staff, kind and responsive host. The hotel and location was well worth the money for the NYC/times square experience. Host was very responsive and kind for any questions or concerns. The hotel was clean, nice and the staff was great. Breakfast was just a typical hotel breakfast with amazing waffles with any toppings you’d like, the hotel staff even made the waffles for us and wrapped it up for us when we wanted to take them up and eat in the room but there was plenty of room in the dining areas to eat as well. As read in other reviews the elevator could be slow at times during breakfast rush, or check in times, but other than that I hardly waited for an elevator and most of the time rode it completely by myself with nobody else inside even during Christmas time. Everything went amazingly and I 10000% recommend this location and host. Thank you so much again! And we will be back for our next trip to Times Square :)

It was exactly as expected. Generally clean hotel room with a king bed, bathroom and mini fridge. We stayed during the Christmas holidays. The staff were very friendly and helpful. They held our bags before check in and after check out so we could walk around without them. The elevators were working perfectly fine despite negative reviews about them. Location is great, on a non busy street but still a 5 min walk to times Square, Bryant Park etc. Was it small? Sure but its a hotel room in NYC I'm not sure why people are expecting spacious - and you aren't there to hang out in the room. Its perfect for changing, sleeping, showering etc. Exactly what you need it for. Only qualm was the toilet was kind of broken. The handle wasnt really working and you had to push down REALLY hard to flush. But I'm sure they will fix that. Also, it isn't fancy by any means and is slightly dated but that doesn't bother us. But I know it does for some people. We would stay again!

The hotel met my expectations. I had no issues with check-in. The elevator was quite busy during peak hours, but fortunately, I was on the 4th floor and could often take the stairs. The hallways were somewhat dirty, but the room itself was clean. The neighborhood felt a little sketchy at night, and they lock the doors at 11 PM; however, you can still get in with a keycard. Booking through Airbnb means you won’t earn hotel rewards points, but it still counts as a stay. Overall, I was happy with my stay. I didn’t reach out to the host, but they appeared to be readily available if needed. I would stay here again and book with this host in the future.

The staff is very friendly, helpful and responsive.  The hotel needs an upgrade. The bed was not that comfortable, the carpet needs a really good shampooing or better yet to be replaced. We didn't want to walk on it with our bare feet.  The lock on the safe in our room didn't work.  The stairs, which we used a lot, seem to be missing from their cleaning list.  The lobby needs an upgrade.   The breakfast is extensive with juices, eggs, all types of breads, muffins, pancakes, oatmeal and more.  The location is fabulous, easy access to subways and main transfer stations. It's a very active hotel with lots of groups coming and going which was not an issue for us, yet might be an issue for others as the lobby has a tiny footprint."

We had a good stay at this hotel. Check-in and check-out were quick and easy, and the staff were friendly and attentive throughout our visit. When we arrived, they let us leave our luggage at the front desk before check-in, and our room was ready a couple of hours early, which we really appreciated. The room had a fair amount of space and while the building is a bit older and the showers were small, it didn’t take away from our stay. Our refrigerator wasn’t very cold, and when we asked the front desk if they could store our cheesecake for us, they gladly did. Overall, everything went smoothly and the staff made sure we were taken care of.

The staff was friendly, professional, and always willing to help with directions or recommendations.
The room was very cozy, smaller than expected. The complimentary breakfast was a nice bonus and saved me time before heading out for the day. Check-in/check-out was smooth and hassle-free.
Overall, this hotel is a great choice for anyone visiting New York and wanting convenience, comfort, and great service.

The hotel provides a basic stay at a reasonable price, for Manhatten.  There was shower gel, shampoo, conditioner, body lotion and hand wash all provided.  Towels, bed linen, fridge and coffee maker also in the room.  The TV is very old and probably the original from when the hotel was established.  This could do with an upgrade.
There was housekeeping daily who made the bed, refreshed the towels and coffee, however, they seemed to not vacuum the floor, which needed doing by the middle of the week.
A very basic hot breakfast along with oatmeal, yogurts, cereals and bread were complimentary with the stay.  The Wales were made fresh for you if you wanted them.

This hotel is very conveniently located, between 8th and 9th Ave.  The Valet Parking is very convenient, although it is perhaps $10 - $15 more per day than would be the case at one of the local garages--but, the convenience for someone arriving with luggage was well worth the extra few dollars.  The people at the front desk were very helpful in all ways.  The breakfast is very good, including omelets or scrambled eggs as well as sausage and good oatmeal and nice baked goods.  I have only one slight complaint: the two elevators are very small, and it can take many, many minutes during the morning hours to catch an elevator that isn't full.  There are at least 30 stories, and so it actually becomes very inconvenient to have to wait for an elevator (for example) when going upstairs after breakfast.  I organized my day around this without much difficulty, including checking out very early in the morning.  The room was spotless.  It was not huge, but it had everything necessary.

I will say that this was one of the cheaper options for a 1-night stay in NYC. I guess you get what you pay for. Check-in was quick. They do charge you for incidentals that are reimbursed to you after your stay. There are only 2 elevators for the whole hotel so waiting to get up and down takes a good 15 minutes. We did not have a working TV our whole stay, no big deal, we were only there for 1 night. We did have an issue with the toilet. After flushing, it kept running water and overflowed. Huge mess. Our door to the room did not close all the way unless you pulled it shut. Huge security issue especially since we were in the room right next to the elevators. Staff was fine. Not great, not bad. Given the choice, I probably wouldn't stay here again.

Location is good, moderately well lit, still need to be conscious of safety walking late in the evening. Staff was amazing. Lady who checked us in at around 1 AM on 9/30/25 was an angel. Check in was delayed for some reason, but she took care of us with Water and a late check out time so we could get some rest. That lady needs a RAISE. 10/10 Housekeeping and breakfast staff were also VERY kind and accommodating. I do wish breakfast went until 10:30 AM at least. Breakfast options were pretty “basic“ but there were many options so that was wonderful. Building was clean and well lit. The room had quite a bit of wear and tear but the linens and bathroom were especially clean looking and the small was mostly neutral, which is really what matters in my book. Bed was comfortable, pillows were NOT. Appear to be some sort of down filling that looked fluffy but flattened as soon as you used it. If you like flat overly squishy pillows you’re in luck. Would stay again if the price was the same.

The hotel is in an amazing location. The neighbourhood is safe and very close to Times Square. The breakfast was good.
The staff at the front desk is very nice, but not really offering solutions or compensation if you have any issues.
About the room, for that price, it’s unacceptable to find the carpet wet and dirty on multiple spots. I had to wash my socks in the sink because I accidentally step on the wet part of the carpet and they became black. We then had to leave a towel to be able to walk on that spot which was exactly in front of the bed.
Plus the bed sheets were completely dirty, with multiple black marks. We asked for new one, but since it was 2 am no one from the cleaning staff was there so we had to remake the bed by ourselves which wouldn’t have been a problem at all if only they would have provided us with the right sheets, king size, instead, they gave us queen size

We were arriving late (like 1am). The gift wasn’t sure how to address this with the hotel, and the hotel typically marks anyone who hasn’t arrived by midnight as a no show. But, one of the hotel employees gave me an email address for the company that owns the hotel. I sent an email and within minutes received confirmation that we wouldn’t be marked as a no show, and the person also provided me with a complimentary late checkout. It was awesome. The hotel itself is in a perfect location, the hotel team was amazing, and we had a blast in NYC. The hotel location was so great that we walked and took the subway everywhere and easily saved hundreds of dollars on taxis/ubers. And, booking a room through AirBnB  saved us hundreds of dollars as compared to booking through the hotel directly. Long and short is that we knew we weren’t going to be in the hotel room very much because we were going to concerts and clubs, so this was perfect for us.

Cons:
- unclean - food leftovers from prior guest was not cleaned from pantry
- manager was responsive about the above, but did not actually take action
- small room - might bump into glass in shower
- way too many guests for only 2 elevators - can be 10-15 min wait times in the mornings

We loved our stay! Check-In was at 3pm, but we were able to check in early which was perfect because our broadway show was at 2pm. The Front Desk was super helpful even though it was a busy Saturday afternoon. They cared for us, even pointed out I should move my car to avoid a parking ticket! No hidden fees. Everything is clearly stated in the instructions they send you. Also, there were no issues booking thru Air-BNB instead of the hotel’s website. We only stayed 1 night, but it was the perfect crash pad after a long day of tourism!"

I was surprised it was a hotel. Has 2 elevators that are small so during busy times you have to wait a long time to get down. My husband walked down from the 24th floor because it was taking so long. Then discovered a door handle to the main floor was missing so had to go to the basement and walk out to the street. Also there wasn’t a phone in the room to call the front desk and no number easily available to call with our mobile phone. It definitely needs a face lift, but the bed was comfortable and close to many things."

Walking distance to Broadway theaters, Carnegie Hall, Empire State Building, Chelsea, etc. and the subway station was ust a couple blocks away. The room was spacious and very well equipped for the price. Lots of good, affordable places to eat on 9th avenue, and most of the high-end midtown restaurants were in walking distance.

This was a very affordable and decent option for staying in Times Square. Honestly, my only complaint was how slow the elevator is. Definitely don’t try and leave the hotel in a hurry because the elevator will surely take a very long time. I was on the 27th floor and probably waited close to 15 minutes for the elevator to reach me. There are only two, and one of them was out of order one of the days I stayed there. Otherwise great spot.

The room was clean and comfortable.   The tv situation was not so good (I'm not sure why MSNBC wasn't available).  The listing said there was wifi, but in fact the wifi was fairly limited unless one paid an extra five dollars. I was stuck in the elevator with some other people when I was trying to leave.   We were out fairly quickly--maybe 15 minutes.   When we did get out a member of staff sort of yelled at us because apparently there were too many people in the elevator (I don't remember seeing a notice about a limit, although he said there was).   In any case I would gladly stay there again.

Booked this hotel through Airbnb and everything seemed fine until I showed up to check in at the front desk. Not only did the lobby smell horrible, the front desk said the booking was a mistake and all rooms were full. Front desk was helpful in explaining that the hosts were given ample time to cancel the reservation due to lack of rooms, but did not do so. Explained the situation to the hosts, who had already reached out previously to tell me my room was ready, and they were the opposite of helpful. They refused to cancel my reservation and refund me and didn’t even offer to help find alternate accommodation. I was alone around midnight in the middle of Times Square and hosts were not helpful or empathetic."

our stay at the hotel was great. it was great that the hotel had breakfast and we could explore the city within walking distance. another big plus was that there was a metro nearby. living here we understood that this is a tourist area, and there are a lot of different strange people around, as well as homeless people. but for us it was not a problem, as the hotel itself was good and the location was completely suitable. so if you are interested in the sights in this area, this hotel is for you. if you want a quiet holiday, you need another area. the only negative, in the room I found a cockroach. I ask the staff to pay attention to this. overall it was clean and comfortable

Very conveniently located, it was possible to walk to all the famous places. Excellent breakfast every day. Very friendly staff and they received several packages that I sent to the hotel. The only downside is that you had to wait for the elevator sometimes because there are only two elevators and 32 floors. But despite that, highly recommended and great value for money.

Excellent hotel, value for money, very good location.
Small downside, you can't close the curtains because of the air conditioning block in the room, you shouldn't be afraid to sleep with the light on. 
The other downside is the inability to add an extra night on site, you have to go through the platform and the prices vary enormously upwards.
Otherwise, very good stay overall.

It was the holiday season in December, and the yen was weak, so I had a hard time finding a place to stay for 4 nights, but this place is in a very convenient location within 15 minutes of Times Square and Grand Central Station, and despite being a Hilton, it was relatively reasonably priced, which was very helpful.
It was quiet at night, and there were many 7-Eleven, fast food stores, and restaurants in the area, so I had no trouble eating.
A fridge, safe, and hair dryer are also provided.
Although the air conditioner was a bit old, the room temperature was stable and we had a pleasant time.
You can also take an Uber in front of the hotel.
During our 4-night stay, the bathroom and sheets were cleaned daily, and we had a peaceful stay.
Breakfast is delicious and there is a service that bakes waffles.
The menu changes daily, but the omelet with vegetables, bacon, and cheese was especially delicious and my favorite.
Also, the host provided check-in instructions and messages about the trip, which made me feel warm.
The only thing that bothered me was the crowded elevator.
We stayed as a couple, but we were over capacity and had to wait a few times, and we were a little tired when we had to wait about 15 minutes to go down from the 16th floor to the 1st floor.
The employees use the same elevator as the guests, and I don't know if it was a malfunction or why, but it frequently stopped on floors where no one was there, and the wait time felt even longer that day.
I'm sorry to ask for a personal request, but I would appreciate it if you could avoid using the elevator for cleaning as much as possible during the busy breakfast hours (6:00-10:00).
During non-crowded hours, I was able to use it smoothly without any particular problems.
Apart from the above, it was a very pleasant stay overall.
I was able to leave my carry-on bag after check-out, so I was able to walk around the city for a few hours before going to the airport, and I really enjoyed my first trip to New York.

The host doesnt appear to communicate with the hotel at all. concerns I've voiced to them they passed the ball and told me to call the hotel directly instead of managing it, it was always my responsibility to figure it out. housekeeping stole my sheet & then refused to look for it because it was also white, even though it was a completely different texture & thickness. I was told a manager would email or call me within 24 hours about compensation - NO ONE has. I told yhe host about it and they passed the buck & told me to call the hotel. I did 3 times and each time no one answered. I bring my own sheets for a REASON, I have photos of the stains on the sheets there but they dont seem to care. also they say they have ice on 3 floors, only 1 of the machines work. long wait for elevators. extremely disappointed with the lack of customer service & follow up

A Perfect Stay in the Heart of NYC!
I recently stayed at the Hampton Inn Times Square South and had a fantastic experience from start to finish. The location is unbeatable—just a short walk to Times Square, subway stations, and plenty of great restaurants and attractions.
The staff were incredibly welcoming and helpful, always ready to assist with a smile. Our room was clean, comfortable, and surprisingly quiet considering the busy area. The beds were cozy, and the bathroom was spotless with good water pressure.
Breakfast each morning was a great bonus—fresh, hot options with something for everyone. We also appreciated the free coffee and tea available throughout the day.
If you’re looking for a convenient, comfortable, and affordable place to stay in Manhattan, this is it. Would definitely stay here again!

Look, this is a Hampton Inn, so it's not REALLY an Air BnB experience. However, I got a great rate going through Air BnB and had all the upside of staying at a brand hotel: it was a safe and predictable experience, with a familiar room, decent workout facility, free breakfast (nothing to sneeze at in NYC!), friendly front desk staff (shout out to Fran!), housekeeping, cable TV, ice machines, complimentary water bottles and snacks upon check-in, etc. Room was small, as expected in Midtown Manhattan, but it was very comfortable for one person, the AC worked brilliantly during a stretch of grossly hot weather and the water temperature and pressure from the sink and the shower were great. Convenient location between 8th & 9th Aves, walkable to Times Square and major bus and subway lines, and yet pretty quiet at night. Really good pizza place across the street - although it's New York, so there's really good pizza every couple of blocks....

I was pleasantly surprised to be offered both early check-in and late check-out, which made my travel experience much smoother.
Throughout my stay, the team was responsive and helpful, promptly addressing any concerns with practical and thoughtful solutions. Their service exceeded my expectations, and I truly appreciated the attention to detail and hospitality.
The hotel also offers very competitive rates for the area, making it a great value for money. I highly recommend this property to anyone visiting New York—whether for business or leisure—looking for a clean, convenient, and welcoming place to stay.

Great Stay – Would Definitely Come Back!
I was pleasantly surprised by how spacious the room was—it wasn’t as small as I expected, especially for New York City. It was more than enough room since we were out exploring most of the day. The air conditioning worked perfectly, and there was plenty of hot water in the shower, which was a big plus.
The hotel was very clean, and I loved that there was always fresh coffee available. Check-in and check-out were smooth, and the elevator was quick after check in and check out 
The only downside was the valet parking—it’s definitely pricey, but that’s to be expected in the city.
The elevator takes long during check in and check out so just plan time wisely but should be expected it’s NYC lots of people 
Valet broke a piece on my door and I got no accident report for it (small piece but still ) 
Overall, I’d 100% stay here again. Highly recommend!

The hotel itself was clean, comfortable, and well-maintained. The room was spacious and quiet, with a cozy bed and everything I needed for a restful night. The complimentary breakfast was fresh and well-stocked, with plenty of options to choose from.

I ended up booking this spot at the last minute during a very busy time in NYC, so options were limited. This listing is actually a hotel room right in the heart of Times Square, and while the location was convenient and the staff were friendly and helpful, the property definitely needs some updates. The room was fine overall—comfortable bed and decent amenities—but the bathroom was a major downside. The shower had a handheld head that wouldn’t stay in place, causing water to spill everywhere. I had to wipe the floor after every shower. The hardware was rusty, and the wallpaper was peeling—definitely not what you’d expect for the price. Elevators were slow, one had flickering lights, and my room key stopped working multiple times. At one point, I needed staff to let me in because the key card machine was down. On the plus side, the breakfast and coffee were both good and a nice way to start the day. Overall, this stay was okay in a pinch, but the property definitely needs updates.

Do not stay here! This is a hotel being operated in an unreliable and confusing manner via AirBnB. We payed for an ostensibly non-refundable room and received detailed confirmation of the booking and all appropriate information for check-in. Yet when we arrived to check-in, which happened to be very late (around midnight) due to delayed trains, we were told that there were no rooms and that we should contact AirBnB for a refund. The receptionist was rude and dismissive and offered no help in providing a refund or in finding us other accommodations in the area (i.e. in Times Square at midnight!). I have requested a refund via AirBnB and am awaiting news from both AirBnB and ""Times Square South NYC."" I have no meaningful news from either and ""Times Square South NYC"" has been evasive and noncommittal in their communication. All in all, an awful experience. This is an irresponsible, disorganized and misleading establishment that does not deserve your money."

This AirB&B is for a hotel run by Hilton/Hampton group and not a home.  I've never stayed in Manhattan before, so for my experience, it was a great location.  We were able to walk to Times Square, our Theater, and Central Park.  There are loads of bars, eateries and shops all around, so never a lack for something to do.  It's a smaller space, so do not expect to have a place to sit other than the bed while having any downtime in the room.  Also, the shower door frame was out of alignment so the doors did not slide well and kept falling off the track (but not out of the channel).  Still, the room was clean, the staff friendly enough.  It was as quiet as one might expect in the middle of the city.  There was an option for parking, however it was double what I was able to find on SpotHero.  There is breakfast available and it's not bad, (though I recommend just eating in the city).  The problem is the dining area is small and the crowd was large.  All in all a great value and stay.

Our commitment to transparency includes displaying all parking options, and we appreciate your understanding. Thank you for mentioning our breakfast and our dedicated staff. Your feedback is invaluable, and we're glad you found your stay to be a great value."

Great location, close to everything on foot and close to the Metro.  Very, very friendly and respectful staff. When I asked for help, they answered my questions, giving directions in English and Spanish. They gave advice on transportation, restaurants and NY attractions. For the price of hotels in NY, this hotel is an excellent option, for its price-quality ratio. And as an extra, the simple but very sufficient breakfast included, allows you to save and go for a walk with a good coffee!!!!

All in all, we were very please. The breakfast was perfect, there was everything to get full. The service there was also very friendly. The location is perfect, relatively many sights are within walking distance. What bothered us a bit was the thin duvet in winter, which also somehow had no real cover and that the shower had sprayed into the bathroom. I had to say 3x that the food from the previous tenant is removed from the refrigerator, which already stank a lot. Unfortunately, we were unable to use the refrigerator.

Everything was great, they returned the deposit very quickly. Breakfast was great, especially the people who serve you, very friendly, fast, they offered waffles as soon as you arrived, wonderful. The room is good, clean, and smells good. The coffee maker didn't work very well, but there was coffee on the 1st floor anyway. Overall, good service.

Great location near the subway and Times Square. It is in a slightly dirtier area of the city but typical of large centers, nothing too bad.
Super friendly receptionists! I was greeted with a kit including water and cookies.
Spacious bedroom and bathroom and flexible check-in, depending on room availability.
I really liked the accommodation and would definitely come back!

The location of the hotel can be smoothly connected with the subsequent itinerary. Whether you like to travel on foot or take the subway and other public transportation, it is a good choice to choose here.I live on the 25th floor, the room and bathroom are quite large, and it is quiet at night.The hotel provides breakfast, and guests of all races gather to interact with each other, which is also a good cross-cultural experience.

DO NOT BOOK THROUGH THIS LISTING! Book directly through the hotel. This listing is hosted by folks in another country and, while kind, they will not honor their own policies. They say they allow cancellation or modification up to 24 hours before check-in but, if they do not see your request in time due to their time zone (Air BnB told me the host of this listing is located in the Philippines) they will NOT honor it even if you request a change prior to the deadline. And Air BnB will not require them to comply  because (and I quote) “The host is not responding”. Literally, they said they would not require the host to comply with my modification request because the host just wouldn’t respond to them. This is wild to me! So I’m out about $200 AND had to spend hours on the phone with Hilton confirming I would be arriving a different day (they also would not honor a refund) AND with Air BnB trying, unsuccessfully, to get this resolved. SKIP THIS LISTING if you can."

This is a Hampton Inn hotel and it left a lot to be desired. The bed sank when you sat on it and should be replaced. The wifi was barely usable.

In the positive side, the front desk staff were friendly and the location was convenient.

My girlfriend and I had saved up a while for a trip to NYC and we were super excited, but ended up leaving early because this place was terrible. First the apartment was not very easy to enter and the owner was unresponsive entirely for 12 hours. When we did manage to get in side the apartment was not well kept, the outdoor area was gross and there was a hot tub with goopy brown liquid oozing out of it. The bathroom was just generally nasty and had to be shared with multiple people. Additionally, we didn’t know there were was going to be other people there as it was never specified in the post and for the price I would absolutely never recommend or come back to this place.
Response from Adam
October 2025
Hi Jacob, thank you for your review. Although, we try our best to keep the space in top quality shape, unfortunately we missed the mark in your experience.
A few things:
You had mentioned that we were unresponsive for 12 hours, but did not mention that you texted once at 9pm and we replied the next morning at 9am. This is a private residence and not a business. Please if you have an emergency, call us. Second, the listing explicitly states ""This is a private room within a shared apartment"" in the description under the title ""Access to the Room"".
You also wrote me a very nasty message after checkout and I don't appreciate that. Thank you for your stay and I apologize that we not meet your standards.

The apartment is centrally located (Google Maps is showing the street next to it.!) , quiet, and within easy reach of Times Square. The kitchen was clean and well equipped. However, my room had a serious ant problem — even on the bed, and unfortunately, I got bitten. On the balcony, there was a dirty bathtub that should be either thoroughly cleaned or removed. It smells bad and attracts insects and mosquitoes. Aside from that, the price is very reasonable compared to other places in NYC.

Adams’s place was very quiet, within a great location and had good security. On the other hand, my girlfriend and I contracted bed bugs after staying there, not having had any bites or bugs on us until the 2 night stay. There was a dead mouse in the bathroom, and bed bugs found in downstairs shower/tub. There were stains on the towels, which were still damp, but we did get new ones provided after requesting. Adam wasn’t very responsive, if it all, but when I asked for two accommodations, he did respect them (leave bags in common room after check out to go eat food before leaving the city, letting us arrive a little early from check in time). The hot tub pool for my patio room I payed for was dirty and not useable. If it wasn’t having had bed bug exposure, the overall stay would have been fair to good.

Adam is a very good host, the neighborhood is close to many places of interest and super quiet for walking at night. I went to a Jazz congress and came back late after each concert and the streets are quiet, there are bars and people on the street.
Highly recommended! I would go back!

First of all, Luz was really nice and she responded quickly to my questions. The house is very close to Manhattan, and close to a busy neighborhood in North Bergen, but is itself in a quiet area. Perfect for exploring the city and at the same time being able to go back to a calm place to rest. The room was clean, and so was the bathroom. From the bedroom window you can see the skyline of Manhattan. And a few meters down the street you also have a great view over to NYC. I would definitely come back to Luz’ house :)

New York can be busy and crowded, but returning to this peaceful neighborhood was the perfect balance for my trip. The bus stop is just a short walk away, and frequent buses to New York made getting around super convenient.
The view along River Road during the ride was stunning, and the skyline view of New York City from West New York is an absolute must-see.
We were extremely happy with the accommodation and truly enjoyed a comfortable and pleasant stay. Thank you for making my trip so wonderful!

The room was big and nice. It was easy to checkin. I didn't get to meet the host in person but it was ok. I was expecting a more homely environment but that's more about my expectations than any fault of the place. I'm not super happy about sharing bathrooms but this one was clean and nice so I liked it. It has a nice park nearby. If one needs to go to Manhattan or anywhere to the east it takes a bit too long time and becomes expensive using the bus or rail everyday. But if you're staying in NJ then it's very nice, and has really nice views of Manhattan since the place is by the coast accross from it. I find it worth the price I paid."

Check-in was extremely easy and there’s a good view of manhattan and walking distance to parks/ local restaurants. Plenty of bus stops nearby so it was very easy to get to NYC taking New Jersey transit. Just note that this is 1 room within a house. At first I thought that meant that I would be the only person staying here because it wasn’t super clear but there’s actually a second floor and a third floor and those are where the other private bedrooms are. It’s not like you’ll be sharing a space with anyone, but you will be sharing a bathroom - there is one on each floor. I think you have to rent to use the microwave or fridge which I think is a little silly especially if you just want to heat up your food. Overall it was very clean and quiet. There’s no central AC but I think each room has a AC window unit and that was enough to keep my room very cool in the third floor. And the shampoo/conditioner/body wash is just a 3-in-one. For the price and location I do think this was a good deal

Very good stay at Gurham's, well located with a 7/11 next door and lots of shops nearby, bus stop just 2 mins from the Airbnb. 
Gurham is very kind and communicates a lot 
The only downside is the sound of the wall between the two bedrooms, otherwise nothing to say, very clean house.

Gurhan offers a wonderful deal with this room: you will get a place in 30min from NYC, and 2 minutes from a bus stop to Port Authority. All amenities included in the bathroom, towels provided. For 5’9 (176cm) person bed was a little bit high. Only issue is that room C (this one) shares a really thin wall with room B, which results in being able to hear everything that happens in the room nearby clearly. For its price, this place was wonderful"

The space was clean and comfortable, there was someone who cleaned the shared and vacant spaces daily. 
I would definitely stay again, the host is friendly and congenial so that’s always a plus!
Great host, great space!"

My experience at Gurhan's residence was exceptional. I encountered no setbacks during my stay. He is extremely attentive, responds promptly, and resolves any issue with readiness, demonstrating to be a remarkable person. Furthermore, the other people present in the house also proved to be very welcoming. I am immensely grateful for everything and have absolutely nothing to complain about. Thank you very much, Gurhan."

Great value considering that you only need to exit Gurhan's property to contemplate the spectacular Manhattan view at night. Bus to the city is down the block and runs all night. The place is quiet and extremely clean. Host & his wife are really kind and Gurhan truly cares about his guests. Thank you so much!"

Great price for the stay! The location is perfect and close to a lot of NYC highlights. The staff were very nice and accommodating. The room itself was great and our partial view of the Empire State Building was a nice surprise. The bathroom was mostly clean, but the tub didn't hold water in for a bath and that was our only issue. It could use some updating. We would stay again.

Good location, close to all the nyc hot spots. Easy check in and the host communicated well up to our stay. Only reason for the low rating was that during our 3 days stay I was killing bug after bug- especially in the bathroom. It made our stay unsettling and I was shocked especially for the price we paid that I was finding bugs on the bathroom floor, in the stair etc."

Really decent hotel- not fancy but more than adequate. Comfy bed and pillows. Great shower and quick hot water. Very fast elevators. We loved the location with easy access to subway, theaters, eateries, Times Square etc. Next time we’ll bring eye masks for sleeping since the nearby giant billboards are brightly lit all night long. We would definitely stay at this hotel again.

Fantastic location! Although right in the center of Times Square, once in your hotel room (we were on the 36th floor), it was so peaceful and quiet. Staff were very helpful, friendly and welcoming. 
Only constructive feedback is the lifts were extremely busy and often had to wait up to 15 minutes to get downstairs to the lobby. Would be a huge bonus if food/drink were available to order to the room.

Amazing location in the center of Times Square. The listing doesn’t mention this, I reached out to the hotel itself, but the highest floor they’re technically able to offer you is the 23rd. Anything above that you’ll have to pay extra. Luckily we got an amazing front desk representative that upgraded us to the 33rd at no cost, which had amazing views. Beautiful hotel and perfect location. Would recommend to anyone wanting to stay in the center of the city at low cost.

We booked for 5 nights. Upon arrival our room was filthy. Discarded peanuts on the floor, dried urine on the bathroom floor. The room was very dated. We were able to cancel the remaining 4 nights through the hotel. Apparently Airbnb and the hotel staff do not communicate properly. Our cancellation was authorized and within policy however, I had to stop the payment through my credit card. 
I have never left a negative review, this venue is unacceptable.

Only downside was the bathroom floor could’ve been cleaner. Had this weird stickiness to it and a slight mildew smell. I think that’s something that can be taken of fairly easily. Other than that it was a fine stay.

Ive been a member here for quiet sometime so ill give them some slack however no mini fridge in the hotel wasn’t great we also had our shower drain clog so bath water was rising before we could get showered (they fixed right away) the first night. Also the room was so hot we had to sleep with the windows open the whole stay but again I’ve been a member for years and will continue with them I believe it was just because of the holiday being so packed we got a back up room or something. Also check the pricing in the convenient store in the hotel we believe to have over paid for some things that didn’t have prices somehow skittles, Twix bar , bottle water and two key chains were 80$ …

if you want to be right in the heart of Times Square for a reasonable price, this is the place. the room and bathroom was clean, and spacious enough. the check in was easy. it was busy but I only waited in line a short time. the restaurant is currently closed. but there are so many food options literally next door and across the street. I truly appreciated the luggage storage service and the bell man handling this was extremely friendly and helpful.  the room did not have the superb city view like the photo but we did not mind. I did not check out the workout room. the staff were all friendly there! I would stay here again if I go back to NYC and especially to this area of Manhattan.

Must remember: hotels in NYC alone, or B&B rooms in expensive hotels, are expensive.
It would help if the host highlighted all additional costs and NYC taxes, and explained what a ""hold"" is on the host's site. 
Jason was an outstanding and responsive host.  He responded right away to my questions and made me feel he was always there.
However, still do not know whether the $100.00 damage deposit ""hold"" was released."

Loved the location and service; the room showed signs of age that looked like a dirty carpet but everything smelled fine and seemed clean, just kinda old.  That said, we’d go back. Despite being ten steps from two theaters where we saw shows, the room was extremely quiet— a restful haven. [Know that you’ll be charged an extra $40/night upon departure per the fine print of the Air BnB contract. The price you see during the AirBnB price comparison does not mention this additional fee.

Beautiful view from the room. The hosts were responsive & front desk was accommodating. The only issue we had was that a random man did follow us up to our room, threatened to S/A us, & put a piece of tissue over our peep hole on door so we couldn’t see out. I’m not sure how he was able to get past front desk security. We end up having to switch rooms for our safety and unfortunately got downgraded as a result of that. The room we got switched to had no view, no fridge, smaller & just not as good as the first room. I do appreciate them for looking out for our safety though."

Our room on the 31st floor had a beautiful city view, and the location was unbeatable — just around the corner from Times Square, yet still quiet at night. Overall, a wonderful experience!

the staff were lovely and helpful at all times except when trying to drop the bag after we checked out. it seemed there was one bell boy taking an extremely long time with each bag and a qué of 20. or so. the manager wasn't receptive and simply said to wait in line.

The stay was decent overall, but there were a few issues worth noting. The room itself didn’t quite match the photos. Our room had some noticeable wear and tear that wasn’t shown in the listing. Amenities were very limited; aside from shampoo, body soap, and conditioner, there weren’t basics like cups for brushing teeth. Another downside was the lack of available power outlets, which made charging devices inconvenient.
This place works if you just need a simple stay, but be aware that it falls short in comfort and amenities compared to what was advertised.

Late Saturday we had maintenance come into our room to fix it, and they informed us all the 18 and 11 rooms were with no heat do to a pipe burst a week ago. Why did they put us in a 18 room? Front desk did give us the option to switch, but it was late at night, and we only were staying 2 more nights. We didn’t want to have to pack everything up. I wish we had. Since I woke up very early Monday (checkout day) w a high fever n flu. They did give us a later checkout. So front did try to make things better. Because of this I would stay again. But our room looked nothing like the photo. We had no views. And it said a coffee machine was in every room, ours did not. We didn’t even have glasses, we had to buy our own. I had high hopes for our room based on the photos and other reviews, and nothing lived up to it. But we would stay again!"

The Millennium has an excellent location to spend a few nights in NYC to enjoy theater , museums and restaurants. The hotel is about 1/4 block from the greater Times Square and in the midst of the theater district. You are 3 blocks from the Times Square half priced tickets window  ( tip: if you are purchase at the tickets window and are taking in another show the next 1-2 days, you can bring your ticket stub and extra an express line instead of the usual (often longer) line) and 2 blocks from the Times Square subway station ( Shuttle to GCT, trains uptown,etc.).
This was our 2nd time staying at the Millennium. We were more pleased with our room last year as it offered in room coffee and a mini-fridge ( not in this year's room). There was also something a bit funky with the HVAC as the room would not heat and hold at the desired temperature. There was a very tolerable workaround, but something I'd rather not be bothered with).
Net net, the Millennium offers a great location.

I felt as though the pictures were nothing like the room we received. We had to make sure that our room was locked at night because someone just pushed the door right open. The room was dirty and the door to the ac filter kept falling down. Upon checking in the hotel clerk was extremely rude however the manager came to make sure that after sitting for hours after we were told room would be ready (per one hotel clerk) and still wasn’t that we were able to get checked right in with no problem. The location is convenient, the baggage clerks were phenomenal, housekeeping could be better, and the little gift shop inside of hotel was great and super nice to my baby. Host did their part, some of the hotel staff just made it a little harder for me.

Our stay at Paris's place was incredible. We felt right at home, it was very comfortable. Paris was a great host and very responsive. The place is located at a great location, walking distance to 3 subway stations and a couple bus stops. It's walking distance as well to Target and Trader Joe's. And there are a lot of restaurants nearby as well. It takes about 20-25 mins to get to times square area from here via subway so it's very convenient. Overall, we had an amazing stay and we'll definitely check if this place is available when we visit again."

Great stay. Small (as described) but very clean and great location. Around 1 hour walk into the centre (times square) or 20 mins on the underground. Also well located for the financial district. Host was very responsive and accommodating. Good spot for doing runs along the river, and seeing lots of sites along the way. Plenty of shops and food places nearby. Would recommend and return."

It was close to so much yet I slept so good every night. I had everything I needed and couldn’t fault anything. Paris really gave you space so it felt like I was almost living alone too. Thank you Paris for a great stay! Couldn’t recommend enough"

Paris was a very kind and welcoming host. I really enjoyed the neighborhood and the food is incredible. she obviously took a lot of time to get the website up and running for checking in and all recommendations are there. she was sweet in the apartment and very non intrusive on shared spaces. do keep in mind you are sharing a restroom with her so there may be times you need to use the bathroom and it's occupied or vice versa. this only happened to me once in three days though and it's absolutely okay especially considering the value of the location you are receiving in New York city. I'd absolutely visit again and appreciate all the free amenities with free earplugs toothbrush and shampoo conditioner and body wash. thanks again!"

Paris was great! She provided me with a guide that had all the steps and answers to questions I had not even imagined. She was very accommodating and help me storing my luggage before check in. The place is small, as shown in pictures but my husband and I were able to fit perfectly, and honestly when in NYC you just go to sleep to the Airbnb so it was not a biggy. I would absolutely stay again at Paris place. Also, it is 10 minutes walking from china town and little Italy so very very walkable and tons of things to do, subway was 3 minutes walking and it was very quiet at night. One flight of stairs but not steep"

I lived in New York for 10 years and it’s hard to come across homes like Paris’s. She was a great communicator and gave straight forward instructions prior to booking. Effortless check in and the hosts accommodations went above and beyond. Would certainly stay here again!"

I booked this stay because the host stated she was living alone, but during the stay an unannounced adult man stayed overnight in the home. I was traveling with a minor, and this was never disclosed before arrival. This completely changed the safety and privacy conditions of the stay.
In addition, the bedroom contained industrial dehumidifiers running constantly, which clearly indicates a pre-existing humidity or air quality problem that was not disclosed in the listing. These are not normal household devices and their presence suggests an ongoing issue with ventilation or moisture.
I believe future guests should be aware that the actual living conditions differ from what is described in the listing, especially for anyone traveling with children or expecting a private and transparent shared-home arrangement.
Response from Paris
November 2025
While I always appreciate feedback, this review does not reflect the true conditions of my home or the experience I provide.
Alejandra required extensive assistance despite clear pre-arrival instructions and a detailed house manual shared well in advance. She arrived nearly six hours before check-in without approval and demanded immediate access while another guest was still in the home, then later locked me out of my own residence. These incidents reflect a failure to follow simple house rules and agreed-upon procedures for check-in and communication.
There were no overnight guests besides myself and the guest, and no industrial dehumidifiers. The listing description and photos clearly show a window A/C unit and a compact HEPA air purifier—both standard for pre-war NYC apartments.
If anything is unclear, guests should contact the host rather than assume the worst. I remain committed to clear communication and a respectful, safe stay for every guest."

There were lots of pots, pans, and silverware that allowed for an easy crafting of breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I was confused on how to enter the building, but he responded right away as I arrived and assisted me with getting in. I would definitely vacation here again."

You know it’s so lovely to feel comfortable as soon as you walk into a room. There was water and cute work desk and internet. Lots of pillows and a comfy bed. Even a noise machine to block out ambience. Actually though it was not a noisy place. It was a superb artfully furnished apartment. What you’d expect when you get to know Casey who is a talented  artist. Thanks Casey for making my visit easeful and accommodating."

This place was perfect for what I needed! Great location. Within walking distance to the shops in soho and all the most popular restaurants. Also close to little Italy and China town. All the popular night life options are nearby as well. Close to NYU so the crowd around this part of town is younger. As a female who was traveling alone, the apartment felt very safe. Comfortable/quiet place to sleep. Casey was very helpful and kind."

I had a wonderful stay in this beautiful East Manhattan apartment! The place was clean, bright, and comfortable — exactly as described. Casey was friendly, helpful, and made check-in very easy. The apartment’s location is perfect, close to great restaurants, cafés, and cultural spots, yet quiet enough to rest after a busy day in the city. I really enjoyed my time here and would definitely stay again. Highly recommended!"

The place is in a great neighbourhood with a lot of good independent breakfast spots around. The bed was very comfortable but the I room I was in was windowless and small and not really a proper room in the flat but an addition. Having said that - the living room and kitchen spaces are lovely but, to be honest, I wasn’t really made to feel at home by the host person present when I arrived. I think this is a must as we are entering their home and need that feeling of being welcome and valued as people. Thus is core in hospitality which is the business that airbnb hosts are in. Also  the signing and use of amenities instructions etc seem to give a vibe that guests were a bit of a nuisance…"

Getting into the building was a challenge as the intercom did not work and I was given the incorrect code for the lock that contained the keys to open the apartment door. Had to wait 20 minutes for someone to come down. The room/apartment was fine, just not as bright as shown in the listing pictures, which was what made it look attractive. I didn’t end up staying due to personal reasons, so the rating is based on what I experienced till the time I left. 3.5/5"

Allison very kindly stored my luggage for a few hours after check-out, which was a great help in NYC. Unfortunately, the room wasn’t made up and the bed wasn’t made by the time I checked in late at night. The lockbox was not easy to find and was buried beneath trash and Allison wasn’t home to assist.
Response from Allison
December 2025
This is NYC. Normally the tree area where I have my lockbox is fully accessible. I have no idea why all those trash bags were there? This is NYC, trash is everywhere and sometimes that happens. I hope you are more flexible and forgiving of future hosts when circumstances beyond their control happen."

The room is as described and has fresh towels available for guests.
Allison's dog was a lovely addition to my stay as she is very friendly and cuddly.

Hello Liyah,
I just wanted to let you know that you took the wrong bus, the one that goes down Tonnelle Avenue.
The one you should have taken was bus 154, which leaves you right on the corner of the property.
If you had told me earlier, I would have gladly given you the correct information so that you would not have any problems. Next time, if you need more precise directions, I'm here to help 😊

The only thing that can be difficult is sharing a bathroom with the other room, but since we knew that in advance, that is not something that would affect how satisfied we were with the place in general.

Clean place. Travel to NY by Bus takes time. Use 3  route instead of 1 then better option.  Overall is Good

Antull I would like to clarify an important point regarding your comment.
From what you describe, you took three different buses (154, 156 and 159), getting off early on each one to change to the next. However, any of those three buses would have taken you directly to Manhattan without having to transfer.
The problem was not with the route itself, but with the decisions made during the journey. By simply taking one of these buses (154, 156, or 159), you would have arrived at your destination without any problems. The mistake was in unnecessarily switching between them during the same route.

A nice space for a short period of time. Nice that there is a general area with cooking facilities. Sharing the bathroom is fine, it just takes time. If you take that into account, that's also easy to do. Quiet area, Manhattan 25 min travel distance. Return trip in the evening, please note the last departure times and routes. Room in perfect order. General area and bathroom kept clean.

The apartment was clean, comfortable and perfectly located with easy access to the city - both by car and public transport. The host was super helpful and quick to respond, which made the whole experience even better. Can definitely be recommended to others who want to experience New York, but would like to stay a little quieter and more relaxed.

Our stay was excellent! The room and apartment were as we saw in the publication. Everything was very clean and organized. Despite having a shared bathroom with other guests, we never had any problems and had a pleasant time. The location of the apartment is good because you can take a bus route that passes two blocks away and leaves you at Port Authority and from there you can move around New York by subway. Lina was nice and always attentive to my questions and helped me a lot with the transportation issue. I recommend this accommodation 100%. The only recommendation is that at the end of our stay it was already very hot in the city and we had no way to turn off the heating or turn on the air conditioning. Everything else is excellent!

The host was extremely responsive and helpful with any questions we had. There was a misunderstanding with the building administration during our stay, and although we expected a more diligent assessment on their part, we were able to clarify everything with proper evidence. Throughout the process, the host remained communicative and very respectful, which we truly appreciated.
Overall, a comfortable stay and a host we would recommend.

Jesus’s place was perfect. It felt just like home — clean, cozy, and exactly like the photos (even better in person).
Jesus was incredibly responsive and helpful throughout our stay. Whenever we had questions, he replied right away, which made everything so easy and stress-free.
The washer and dryer were a huge plus, especially while traveling. The fridge had filtered water and an ice dispenser, so we never needed to buy bottled water during our Manhattan trips — such a thoughtful detail.
The location was also amazing. It took only about 20–25 minutes to get to Manhattan, which saved us so much time. There were great restaurants and pizza places nearby, and the area felt safe and convenient.
This was our first trip to New York, and staying here truly made it unforgettable. We felt happy, comfortable, and cared for every day.
We would definitely love to stay here again next time we visit NYC.
Highly recommended — truly an amazing stay. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

Review of BNB Stay – Average Experience
My stay at this BNB was overall average. The biggest issue was the lack of proper soundproofing. Music played loudly throughout the night, making it very difficult to sleep. I raised the concern with the owners ( happening 2 nights) , and they asked me to message if the music continued after 23:00. I did so, but the music still did not stop. Their response was to “adjust for today” and that the issue would be addressed tomorrow. Unfortunately, the same problem persisted, and since it was my last day, I had no choice but to manage with limited sleep before vacating. Even though the owners assured me they would resolve the issue, nothing was actually done.
Pros:
• Room size is decent
• Bed is comfortable
• Bathroom is tidy
• Shared kitchen is clean, with fridge and stove available for use
Cons:
• Not ideal for New York travel, as it’s far from main attractions
• Commuting to New York is challenging
• Very noisy street
• No proper soundproofing
Response from Neeti
December 2025
Hi Satish,
Thank you for taking the time to share your detailed feedback. We truly appreciate it and are sorry to hear that your experience was impacted by noise during your stay.
We’d like to clarify that the noise you experienced was not coming from inside the home, but from a neighboring property across the street that had Christmas decorations with music/jingles playing during the holiday period. As this is normally a quiet, residential street, the sound carried more than usual at night. We completely understand how disruptive this must have been, especially when trying to rest.
We did make multiple attempts (on three separate occasions) to reach out and address the situation with the neighbors, but unfortunately we were unable to get a response at the time.
Thank you again for staying with us and for sharing your experience in a thoughtful way. We wish you the very best in your future travels.

Hatis was extremely kind and helpful. My luggage arrived one day late and she went all the way to help me - from calling Delta to lending me her son's clothes without me asking. The place was clean and cozy! Location was great as there's a NJ transit bus stop right in front of the building. You could get into midtown Manhattan under 20 minutes from the apartment. Highly recommended! I'd stay there again when I'm in NY!"

The place is only a few minutes by bus to Manhattan's Port Authority Bus Terminal and you can connect with the Subway there too.
Pro tip, download the NJ Transit app in advance, it'll be easier to purchase tickets for the bus 😉
I'd Absolutely stay again at Hatis place, 1000% recommend ❤️❤️❤️"

If you are visiting NYC, don’t hesitate to book Hatice’s place! It’s so close to Manhattan and the bus stops right in front of the house. There is so much to love about this place - the view is exceptional, the room is spacious and the bed really comfortable.
Hatice is a wonderful host. She is kind, sociable and by the end of my stay she felt like a friend I’ve known for years! Her hospitality is second to none and staying with her felt truly wonderful.
The bus takes about 20 minutes to get to Port Authority via the Lincoln tunnel and runs frequently. It’s also easy to get to Hatice’s place from Newark airport.
I look forward to staying again - highly recommend this place ☺️"

Thanks to you, I was able to enjoy my trip to New York better. I was also grateful for the coffee and tea you prepared every day. I'll definitely go to New York again during the Christmas season someday! See you again, Hatis!

This is a great spot for a short visit. It i close to the subway and short walking distance to the Midtown tourist core. There is only one bathroom to share among the four rooms, and it is possible to hear other guests through the walls. But it was inexpensive and in a good location, so these minor inconveniences made it worth it to me. If you happen to be looking for a spot to stay overnight while you're in town for a play--like Masquerade, for example--this is an excellent choice!"

Michelle was a great host. Gave very clear directions, couldn't have been easier to get into her place. She was very responsive when I needed her and her place is in the perfect location with everything you could want around the area. There's a grocery store right across the street and restaurants/bars all over the place. Her place is a short drive under 10mins from the train station and walking distance to the theater district (10mins) or other things like 20-30mins. We walked everywhere and was very easy to get around. The room had a microwave, mini fridge and hot plate. Made it super convenient for us to cook up our own food. You are on a floor with 4 other rooms with everyone sharing 1 bathroom. There was no issues with that and everyone respected the bathroom rules laid out. Only thing was the people in 1 of the rooms were loud after quiet hours which was unfortunate but other than that we had a great stay. highly recommended

The location is great -- very close to a subway station and some great restaurants and attractions! However, there are serious issues with the rental unit. The address listed on Airbnb does not match the real address, which is only provided two days in advance via a third party website. This is also not an apartment, but one room among many in a basement that's been renovated for Airbnb. Finally, as a basement unit in NYC, expect cockroaches."

The communication with the host was pretty bad though, she said to reach out with any questions and I tried to reach her like 5 times over a 1,5 day period and she never replied. Just automated messages completely ignoring my messages. Very frustrating. Kitchen is not really a kitchen just some shelves. But location is great, and still a good find for the price."

Pretty expensive, but you pay for the great location. Great for spending a few days in the city when you want to be central. The room was fine for one person, could be a bit tight for two people with big suitcases. 
All in all a nice stay and especially a great neighborhood."

Everything was excellent, in terms of price-quality, it is what is necessary and it has a super good location, the only thing is that the bathroom is shared and although it is presentable at times it smelled a little bad but it was because of the other guests, since they did not leave it so clean. Michelle's service was excellent.

The room was – as often the case in New York – very small, really only suitable for sleeping. The location was great (just minutes from Times Square) and everything was clean – including the bathroom you share with other guests and where the toilet is located. Unfortunately, the host was difficult to reach and only responded to our message after a longer period of time. After all, we were allowed to leave our luggage earlier. Overall ok for New York, but you should know that the space is very limited.

The place was in *such* a great part of town, and the room was as described. I was worried sharing a bathroom with four other rooms might be chaotic, but there was only one time where it was even a bit of an issue.  The place was clean. There was a Keurig in the room, but no cups provided, so bring your own if you want to take advantage of that! My only concern was that the address was different than advertised, which had me a bit concerned about the accuracy of the rest of the listing, but I can confirm that the place felt secure and the rest of the listing is very accurate! On the border of midtown and Hell’s Kitchen; you won’t find a better deal! Thanks, Michelle!"

Everything went well, place was very clean and cozy, loved that such a tiny room had a TV. Room  and bathroom were great, and small kitchenette also carried coffeemaker and mircowave which were handy for our last morning before checkout. Only there was miscommunication with early bag drop-off, as we arrived early but couldn’t get it, texted Michelle and there was no response and neither further communications she mentioned and apologized for not responding as we were standing outside waiting for 20mins in cold. Ended up dropping our bags at hotel nearby. 
Overall great location, walkable to most tourist places, good value for money for NYC at Christmas season.

I wasn't expecting a lot when I jumped on this space. it was clean, comfortable, had shades that were good enough to black out the room. Granted it wouldn't have gotten much sun anyways, but there's always something with a room being completely dark that just makes it that much more cozy when laying down for bed. You hear next to no street noise in this space. The only real issues were doors squeaking and it being a shared space with others, but I personally couldn't count that against the space. it is well within walking distance to everything you could want to go to in NYC. I highly recommend!"

This place is at excellent location, 12 mins walking distance to Time Square and a few mins to 50St. subway. It's in the basement at the back of main road so it's really quiet. There are two locks in the front building, one at the basement door. and another one at the room door. My friend and I are two females, even we came back late (around 11.30pm) we still feel safe. It's super clean just like the photos. Since it's a shared space there are 3 rooms share one washroom. We need to manage the time to use the washroom. The host provides shampoo, body wash, hair dyer, cotton swab and towels. There is a TV and AC in the room, but the AC is a bit loud so we turn if off in the night. Host is responsive and the check-in instructions is easy to understand. Overall, it's a great place, we will stay there again if we go to NY in the future."

I'd 100% recommend Willow's place. From the easy commute NYC>NJ>NYC, to clear instructions on how to check in, to restaurant recommendations, to friendly conversations and finally to the great spot to stay while visiting the city.
I was a bit nervous about staying outside of NYC since my plans were all there, but boy was I wrong. Commuting to and from the Port Authority Bus Terminal is very simple and fast. You also have the ferry option which is a bit more expensive but worth it if you want to avoid traffic or want a beautiful view of the skyline. And speaking of that, what an amazing view you get of the city once you hop off the bus in Weehawken!
Check in was smooth, bedroom was comfortable and shared bathroom was not a problem. Everything was clean and it almost felt we had the place to ourselves. 
A snowstorm hit NY when we arrived, so we had to change our plans a bit on the first day and stay in NJ, but there were great restaurants walking distance from the house. Thank you Willow

Easy transportation on the 128/166/165 route from the corner into Manhatten. Download the NJ Transit app and pre-purchase tickets each time! From there let your feet or the subway take you anywhere!
The bed was super comfortable, and everything was meticulously clean. Willow had a great selection of teas and coffee with various sugars and some creamer to start the day right! 
The view at night time of the Manhattan skyline is not to be missed! Easily walkable to many restaurants and local grocery at Lidl.

The neighborhood, the art, the history, the energy, the little Italian restaurant around the corner (that perfect bolognese), and the most generous hospitality — my only serious complaint is that I found it extremely difficult to leave!

My stay overall was nice, the host was very communicative and friendly and the bus route to get into New York was very easy and convenient. When I booked my stay I didn’t realize there would be other people in the home besides the host, so just be aware there are multiple rooms all sharing one bathroom."

Great place to stay. Check in was very easy thanks to Odalis’s instructions. Good location, buses that go to NYC- port authority bus terminal, usually arrive early and it takes about 30-40 minutes to get there so pretty easy. For tickets-download NJ transit app and select interstate 2 zone ride. Room was accurate and really nice, everything clean. 
Thank you for hosting me!"

The host is very attentive, and the cleanliness of the place is a big plus. However, I did experience some noise at night and had trouble sleeping at times. Also, the connection between NJ and NY is complicated and expensive: the transportation is not very comfortable, often crowded, expensive, and sometimes infrequent. Still, the view of NY from NJ is definitely worth it If you’re a city fan like me."

A very good deal if you plan on being out all day. The room is small though and the walls are thin, just be aware of that. Weird hole in ceiling above the bed, I don't know what that was.

Response from Gloria

Lilli,
I’m sorry to hear that you didn’t have a good experience in my home. The “weird hole in the ceiling” was a cloth that covers the attic access cover. I could have explained that to you had you asked.
It’s also unfortunate that my dog Rascal didn’t like you. It’s a very rare occurrence and typically happens when a guest doesn’t like him either.
I wish you the best on your next journey and hope that you find a better match which meets your expectations.
Be well,
Gloria"

I had a small room that looked exactly like the pictures, the bathroom was always available for me and the whole house was at my disposal and was very well equipped and nicely decorated. There is a central train station a 15-minute walk away and the neighborhood is very safe, even at night. Recommend! The most important thing - Gloria was completely available for me and helped me nicely."

Everything was great! From the location, the room, the skyline view, the hosts’ friendly hospitality. The stay added to my NYC experience being able to see what daily life is like in the neighborhoods/Burroughs with all the coffee shops, restaurants, bars. I loved everything about it. Close to ALL of the major NYC attractions- all over Manhattan I was able to walk, rent Citi E-Bikes, bus rides, subway stations to get around very easily with Google Maps. Definitely recommend Reka’s place in East Village. Great experience."

The lighting during the day was lovely, and ambient at night. Overall I loved their space and had a great experience. It’s perfect for experiencing the city with a more local atmosphere. Definitely a great choice, for sure would stay again!"

Quiet and peaceful neighbourhood. 5 min walk to many buses. Appreciated that Bus M14D, in particular, had frequent service. 
What I loved most was how cosy the apartment felt - the decor and extensive collection of plants gave life to the space!Bed was reaaaaally comfortable and felt like hotel grade mattress. Shower hot with high water pressure. Face linens were so lux! 
Reka and Adam were friendly, responsive, and accommodating with special requests. Would stay here again if I were to return to NYC. Highly recommend!"

I had a lovely stay at Reka’s place in the Lower East Side. The room was spotless, cozy-comfortable, the AC worked perfectly, and everything was just as described. The location was the reason I booked it; conveniently located walking distance to shopping and Russ & Daughters. What really stood out was how communicative and friendly Reka was. She was incredibly easy to coordinate with, even when my train was delayed and I arrived late. Although I didn’t get to meet her in person, her helpfulness and warm communication made my stay smooth and enjoyable. It felt like I was staying with a friend in LES, and I'd totally stay here again."

Loved staying with Reka. If you wanna experience the real New York and not just Midtown but still have a central location, this is the place. The neighborhood felt very save and alive but it was still quite most nights. The room had the perfect size and I felt really comfortable coming back from an exhausting day exploring every night. I made myself breakfast in the kitchen every morning and even did my laundry once. Reka explained everything and if I had any additional questions she would help me out right away.
I would highly recommend staying with Reka, especially if you want to feel like a real New Yorker!"

The place is really great. Some might feel its away from the city centre but I felt it to be quite recharging after the non stop chaos of NYC and the bus stop is just outside(frequency of busses is quite high) which take 20 mins to reach NYC. The view of the skyline of NYC both in day and night is quite mesmerizing. The park nearby gives perfect spot for that. The place had everything which was mentioned, its a quiet neighborhood and a good pizza and Chinese place 3 mins walk away, so all in all I think its a great deal if one wants to take a break after all day chaos in NYC"

Gurhan's place was the perfect stay for visiting New York for a week! It is beautifully located just a 2mins walk from the Hudson river with amazing views of Manhatten skyline. Honestly a dream to just talk a short walk every morning with that view! Bus connections to New York were also super convenient and Gurhan was super helpful with instructions. What I appreciated most was that he treats the place really like a home - he also lives in one of the rooms which is why you get more than the bare minimum equippment like in so many other Airbnbs. It was always super clean, the flat is modern and rennovated and the kitchen is super well equipped. The rooms have super nice storage options to make the most of the little space which is great!  It really felt more as if we were flatmates - with the additional benefit that Gurhan was always making sure that I got everything I needed for a perfect stay. He can give great recommendations for rooftop bars in NYC! 10/10 recommend!"

Gurham was a great host! The bed was comfy and the space was perfect for a quick overnight stay. The location was perfect—right by the bus stop. 
That said, if you’re sensitive to light or sound while sleeping, there are a couple things to keep in mind.  The foam wall separating my room (room B) from the other half of the bedroom was thin, so I did wake up when my neighbor came home and opened their door (it sounded like someone was opening my door, it was that loud). Generally, everyone was quiet. 
Also, the bedroom door has glass window panes that have been painted over with white paint, so if a neighboring guest leaves the shared living room/bathroom lights on it’s pretty bright in the bedroom. I had to turn it back off a couple times after I’d gone to bed (between midnight and 2am). That’s not a reflection or Gurham, so he gets 5 stars, but some things were less than ideal for me, personally.
Gurham was very helpful and friendly, and the AC unit worked great in the warmth!"

Easy self check-in and entry/exit (passcode), clean common areas and great amenities. Gurhan is easy to communicate with and only on-site for routine cleanup. It's a 20-30 min commute to NYC (via NJTransit bus), and grocery stores/laundromats are accessible by foot and public transit. The location is steps away from a Hudson river overlook, and provides beautiful views of the New York City skyline. 
Overall very pleased with the experience; this is an excellent place to stay if your priority is affordability and a clean bed to sleep on. The rooms aren't huge, but they are functional and comfortable. So long as your neighboring tenant respects quiet hours, there are no issues with the styrofoam divider between Room B and C."

I’m sure you’ve already read in other reviews how well-kept, quiet, and conveniently located Gurnham’s place is—all of that is absolutely true and matched my experience perfectly. But what really stood out was Gurnham’s proactive and thoughtful hosting. When I asked if I could leave my bags after checkout, he went above and beyond—calling the next guests to confirm their arrival time and allowing me to stay until just an hour before they arrived. It made my travel day so much smoother, and he still ensured his team had time to prepare the space. Incredible customer service. I’ll definitely stay here again!"

West New York was really a find! It's about 25 minutes from 42nd in downtown New York and you only pay $4.10 for it. Gurhan's Airbnb is very different. There is a drinking fountain with water, which is very rare on Airbnb in the US, where I almost always have to buy drinking water. Apart from other things like microwave, hot water, refrigerator, internet and so on. Gurhan is very nice and a very friendly and helpful host. I already told him I'm back next year.

The only inconvenience, in my opinion, is the shared bathroom for the entire floor (5 rooms), so sometimes you have to wait. There’s also poor sound insulation — you can clearly hear what’s happening in other rooms, like the TV or conversations. Overall, it’s a great option for those who need to stay a few nights at an affordable price in a quiet neighborhood"

Excellent host, and good location, very easy to get to Manhattan. In a matter of 20 minutes and the stop is next door. The value for money is pretty good for being in New Jersey. I think that if you're traveling alone, and your intention is to venture into New York, it can be a good option for a good price.

The place is excellent, just like the photos. Luz was super attentive and responded quickly, even when I ran out of internet and had to send her an SMS. The bus stop that goes to New York is a few meters away and for 4 USD, and seeing Manhattan while you wait for the bus is not to be missed. Perfect heating, the days were between -12 and -6 degrees. I'll be back. 
The only clarification, and it has nothing to do with the place, is that if you go with heavy and large suitcases, the staircase is a spiral staircase, but it is not an impediment, it will just take you longer to go up and down.

Just a very small room, bed is really hard though. The little room with only one toilet does not have a lock which is weird. Otherwise the place is clean and conveniently a quick walk to the subway and right into Manhattan. The price wasn't too bad for what you get. The only downside was no air or fan, I sleep hot. But was not a bad air BNB.

We have a full bathroom and a half-bathroom, and although the half-bathroom doesn't have a lock, there's a sign indicating whether it's free or occupied. During the winter months in New York, the air conditioning is not used. However, please know that we are always available to help with anything you need, as we live in the house. If we had known there was any concern about the temperature, we would have gladly provided a fan; we are always available to offer the best for our guests. Thank you."

Great place to stay with walkable distance to the subway. I was able to get to Grand Central station in about 25 mins. Host was very responsive and the place has other guests as well staying in their own rooms. The entire house has a shared kitchen and living area. Only downside was the noise from the outside from cars passing by, which isn't really related to the property but just a heads up. Also, there was a guy outside the front door who approached me, thankfully I got into the property just in time but he stood outside the door waiting. Just be a little extra cautious.
Overall, I enjoyed the stay and the price was well worth it. Host was accommodating."

The location is a quiet residential area, but I could hear party music on weekend nights. However, I was fine because earplugs were provided. It was a bit disappointing that the windows didn't open, but it was a comfortable stay. Thank you!

Hello, thank you very much for staying at our house! As you saw, there are many hotels near our house with rooftops on the weekend, where they have parties. The lower part of the window has air conditioning because it's summer, but there's a note on the window saying that you can open the upper part. Maybe you didn't see it. I hope to welcome you back to our house. Thank you very much."

I would definitely use Victoria's again if I ever get back to New York.
It was my first ever lifetime visit there and I would recommend everybody that I know and use her location again.

Proceeds from the rental go towards the community soup kitchen that  Adi runs and we happily volunteered to help one morning (though there was no pressure to do so). Location was fine but it is in the Lower East Village, so plan transportation/time accordingly for your activities in midtown/Central Park area.
Lovely stay. Will stay again."

Loved helping out with his hot meal program for homeless and disadvantaged people. Really friendly group preparing and distributing the meals. 
Alfreds place has a calm ambience and my room was excellent.
Unfortunately while in the house no one talked, the other two residents when at home stayed in their bedrooms. It made me feel like I was intruding on their house and I felt very uncomfortable especially with the man (Richard).  
I tried sitting in the small and pleasant lounge a coupke of nights to read and have a nice herbal tea, to relax and hopefully chat or meet the residents. Unfortunately that never eventuated.
While I liked Alfred's house, and he is a lovely person, I thought about moving out early."

	Her house is very clean, and I especially want to mention the kitchen. It is well equipped with many tools. Mel even provided an egg boiler, which I really loved.
	The transportation is very convenient. If you want to visit New York, you just need to cross the street and take the 156 or 159 bus. The fare is $4.10 per person.
	I would definitely book this place again if I plan to visit New York in the future."

Mel is a very responsive and accommodating host. The check-in experience was very smooth as I could leave my luggage for holding early. Very accommodating when I needed the room to be cleaned more frequently. When the bedroom door lock stopped working, Mel was very prompt in offering a nicer location to stay in while also tending to the repairs immediately. Would highly recommend staying here."

This is a great deal for what you pay for and expected for a shared common space location!
The walk and location was awesome. There are some really great bakeries and cafés nearby. Lots of food as well.  And close to public transportation.
I came here because my sister lives in five walking distance from here so it was extremely convenient
Many home the upstairs basement. Depending which room that you rent, the shared space is different. Basic amenities provided which was great (toothbrush, towels, loufahs, coffee pods, basic cooking supplies etc). The actual room was nice and private, was a tad musty because I came during humidity season, but once I turned on  the AC, all was good :) 
I had an instance where we ran out of toilet paper, but after communicating with Mel, it was resolved within hours — fantastic communication. She was so responsive! 
Would definitely recommend people coming for a short or affordable stay to rent!"

I think Michelle's place is the best choice for people who want to save money for lodging. She was very responsive and super helpful especially when I asked her about the shortest route to get her place. The only thing I was disappointed was that the bedding was a little bit stinky. However, since I didn't expect a hotel-quality here, it was tolerable for me. Other than that, everything was clean and just perfect! 9.9 out of 10!

Michelle’s place was perfectly located and we truly enjoyed our time in NYC. Michelle was also helpful at all times and incredibly responsive. 
We were 5 minutes from Times Square and the ACE line. You share the bathroom with three other rooms, so there is a bit of traffic going in and out. It was also incredibly loud at night so definitely bring headphones or use the provided earplugs. It was a good stay for the price.

The place is very well located with lots to do around. 
There were stairs and it was hard to go up with my luggage. However when I left a very kind young lady, part of her staff,  helped me with my bags. 
A suggestion for Michelle: please offer a couple of bath towels and a face towel. That would have been nice. I would have paid more for that. 
Check out was at 11:00 am, Mario was very accommodating allowing me to keep my luggage in until 2:30pm. 
I had a great stay! Thank you Mario and Michelle.

Michelle’s place was just perfect for my quick little getaway. Because I traveled alone I wanted something right in the middle of all of my activities and also easy to access the subway. All of the above were meet. Loved how easy the check-in was with everything being smart home, I didn’t have to worry about remembering any codes. The place was so cute just as listed! I felt completely safe and Michelle was also very reassuring and answered any questions I had which gave me even more peace of mind. I will definitely be coming back and booking with Michelle! Any girls out there looking for the perfect spot to visit all the attractions and best transportation options, I definitely recommend this. Oh and a little tip and bonus was that the Uber airport shuttle is $20 and drops you off in the same block where this is located! But wait there’s more! If you use Bounce to hold your luggage is right around the corner! Seriously cannot get any better! Thank you again, Michelle!!"

As a host, she was very helpful and responsive. It felt like there was always someone on hand if I needed help.
This was also a really great place to stay in a vibrant bustling area. Perfect for an active city break!
This was my first time in the city and if I return (highly likely) I will certainly consider staying here again :)

This was my first time in New York for a very quick stop (not vacation) and Michelle was extremely helpful with subway routes, answering questions, etc. It was also my first time only booking a room with a shared bathroom situation. 
My room was clean, cool as soon as I walked in - which I was so thankful for, and the bedding and sheets were very soft and comfortable. My room window was closest to the street & there were some loud people at night, but it didn’t bother me & I was still able to go to sleep. 
The price point was a big factor for my stay & budget. I would absolutely book again."

Michelle place is great for someone who wants to be at walking distance from times square and central park. There are good eating and coffee places near by. The room is well kept and comfortable. If you are ok with the various surrounding noise then its a good set up ..Overall had a good stay.Michelle's place is a gem for anyone eager to stretch their legs and meander to Times Square and Central Park. The local dining and coffee spots? Chef’s kiss! The room itself is tidy and cozy, like a warm hug after a long day of exploring. Just a heads up—if you're not a fan of the occasional New York symphony (a.k.a. city noise), you might want to bring some earplugs. But hey, if you can roll with it, you’ve got yourself a fabulous setup! All in all, a delightful stay!

Cimen and her brother have always been super helpful and never hesitated to help me out or lend me a hand. They were very welcoming and kind. I stayed here for over a month so I can definitely recommend long stays.  
West New York is a great area with little cafes and restaurants and the view to Manhatten is absolutely amazing. The Bus stop is near and it only takes 20-30mins to Manhatten. I always felt safe here. Even at night the Bus from Manhatten to WNY was always full and people are very warm and kind here in general. There is a nice park near and you can use different buses to visit different areas in NJ. I recommend  „Little Japan“ in Edgewater which is just 20mins from the airbnb
I think this is the perfect spot if you‘re looking for a cozy and calm space and don’t want to be too far away from the city. Would always book here again!"

Hosts were very responsive and friendly. The location of the house is excellent, very close to New York. There are buses that take to NY every 10 minutes at the price of $4, and the route lasts about 15-20 minutes. The house is very cosy, it has a well-equipped kitchen and the room is very large and comfortable. I recommend it!

A great host who welcomed us even after midnight. Decent housing at a reasonable price. Great travel accessibility, 5 min walk to the bus stop (runs every 10 min) which will get you to Manhattan in 20 min for $2.80. Right next to the house there is a 7eleven. The house is a little older, which you can see, but for the price you pay, it's a great offer. I recommend

We stayed here during a severe cold wave in New York, and there was a serious problem with the heating. The room temperature dropped to around 7–8°C (mid-40s°F or lower), which felt unsafe.
We were repeatedly told that the heating system was “fully controlled” and that guests must not touch it, and that “there should be no problem.” However, the room never warmed up. The bedding provided was only one very thin, summer-style blanket per person. When we asked for extra bedding, we were told it was not necessary and that “comfort depends on the person,” and that additional blankets would cost $15 each. Even those were very thin. Because we had a minor with us, we asked again and only one thin blanket was added.
It was so cold that we had to sleep wearing down jackets. There was no space heater or any alternative provided, and at one point we were even warming our hands with a hair dryer. On the coldest days, we genuinely felt it was unsafe and had to move to a hotel.

We’re sorry you felt uncomfortable during an extreme cold spell. Once we were notified, we came in person, reset the system, confirmed heat restored, and offered a temporary heater while the home warmed back up. Extra bedding was also provided upon request. For accuracy, the review mentions a ‘minor,’ but the reservation group was adults. We take guest comfort seriously and are always available to help immediately."

It has a beautiful view of the city, a 3-minute walk or less, shops nearby. 
The other tenants weren't annoying, in fact we never saw them.

We had a wonderful stay, and we were pleasantly surprised by the location of the Airbnb: bus 3 min walk, which leads to Port Authority / Times Squares in 25 min (count $8.20 round trip, as it is the NJT network).
The cleaning, whether in the room or in the common areas, was impeccable, and the bedding was also very comfortable, and the room was quite large!
We did not use the living room or kitchen, but at first glance, they seem very well equipped like the whole apartment. 
If you need anything or have a problem, the hosts have always been responsive to find a solution. We highly recommend these hosts and this Airbnb, it's great value for money for NYC!

The bus stops are close by and you get a beautiful view of Manhattan on the way there. 
The only thing was, that we couldn’t get the door closed. It didn’t stay closed well and we didn’t get it to lock. They tried to instruct us, but we didn’t get it to lock. It was a bit scary but all went well and we had a super good stay! Would def recommend!"

We would probably stay in the city next time mostly likely, only because we have our kids with us  and taking the bus transportation from there and back is very hectic if you’re not familiar with the bus routes.

Good location in New York for my first time there. Could walk everywhere. Amenities were all good.  It being Christmas time, there were a lot of sellers on the street just outside of entrance and made sidewalks crowded. The heating struggled a bit on the days that were really cold and snowing. I had some issues Christmas Eve and staff still helped on this busy night."

Great value for the location. The biggest plus is that it’s right in front of the subway, making it super convenient to get around NYC. Rooms are small, as expected for the area, and the surroundings can be noisy, especially at night. If you’re prioritizing location and price over space and quiet, this is a solid option."

This place was convenient to a lot of spots in lower Manhattan/Chinatown. It was roomy for two people and easily accessible. 
It is in a part of the city that has heavy foot traffic and noises so if you are a light sleeper, maybe not the best spot, but they provide earplugs. 
Communication is great and check in was easy! If you're just going out to explore the city, definitely recommend!"

It is very conveniently located, and it was fairly quiet. I slept well in a comfortable bed. It was rather expensive for the quality of the lobby and neighborhood, but that is to be expected for Manhattan. I was, however, quite satisfied to have a good comfortable rest in the midst of a very busy and exciting city.

There was no microwave or refrigerator. You had to go downstairs to warm up you food but would you even want to if you can refrigerate it. They did have a communal refrigerator if you trust it. The lobby where they had the microwave and communal refrigerator was nice, clean, welcoming however if you don’t wan to have to get dressed up and/or socialize too early in the morning you would want a microwave or refrigerator in your room."

The hotel is in a very strategic area for shopping, because all of Soho is close to you (Alo Yoga, Lululemon, North Face, Target, TJ Maxx, etc.)
I would definitely come back. It is the best price/quality option if you visit New York."

I mourn the days when I could use Airbnb NYC to stay in someone’s cute place, but this exceeded expectations in terms of being clean and safe and — at this price point — having my own bathroom. My only complaint is the 10 AM checkout time. You can request extension, but I wasn’t aware of this within the 12-hour period (that’s on me). I had a spacious room AND bathroom with shower. Location was excellent."

The place is somewhat noisy (the room was on a 2nd floor on the Canal St front), but I could sleep very well. The room is really small, but complete.
I'd definitely stay there again. Thanks for eveything!"

The room was super cold at night and using the thermostat did nothing. The chair was dirty and there was tons of dust on the bed. The wall had tons of holes and the bathroom was clean. The floor was dirty with visible stains. I had encountered a suspicious male at 5ish am on the lobby while there was a worker watching and I went up the elevator fast. I heard a knock 2 minutes later and it was the same guy pacing back and forth down the hallway. Be careful when you’re returning to your room. Photos of booking didn’t match room"

Desk worker was very helpful and understanding, always willing to assist. Room perhaps a bit smaller and less cozy than the cover picture, but mostly just a result of having a corner room. Area was dense, busy, a bit sketchy, but easy to navigate and very convenient. The first night, there was a small but noticeable wafting smell for about ~20-30 minutes; not sure what it may have been, but did not seem characteristic of the hotel at all. Very worth the price, although I did receive a discount."

They provide extra amenities at the front desk and also an extra charging cable! We also like how convenient the location is to get to different places, there’s also a lot of people and traffic right outside.

Great location for the price. The view from the hotel window is not particularly impressive, and the photos are somewhat misleading—if you are looking to enjoy a city view, this is not the right place. However, if you simply need a comfortable place to stay while exploring the city, it is a great option. Public transportation is very convenient, Chinatown is within walking distance, and Times Square is about 20 minutes away by metro. There are also plenty of restaurants and street food carts just a minute away."

I stayed with them during the early months of the winter, and they were having some difficulties with managing the heat in the building (too hot). Even so, they were very responsive when I expressed any needs — and I assume that they will get the heat situation (old building with radiant heat) figured out soon.

My husband and I stayed in one of the queen-sized bedrooms for 4 nights and had a great experience. Alex was very accommodating to my request for a room on a lower floor that was due to an ankle injury. Everyone we interacted with was very friendly. The photos and description matched exactly with reality and everything was clean / tidy, including the shared bathroom and shower. The location couldn’t be beat - walkable to so much and close to several subway options. If you are a light sleeper, I would recommend ear plugs or even noise canceling headphones as there is a fair amount of noise from people coming and going (which is to be expected) and it’s an old building with little insulation (totally normal for NYC). Other than that, it really did feel like a tranquil space in the chaotic city!

I really appreciated Alex's helpfulness and attention – when I first stopped by my room I was a bit nervous to find it quite hot (as they're still figuring out the heating during their first winter in the building) and was worried I wouldn't be able to sleep well that night, but Alex made sure to get the AC going and check that the room cooled while I was out for the evening. I came back to a perfectly cool room where I slept like a baby :) I very much appreciated the thoughtfulness! Thank you for a lovely stay.

I was charmed by both the host and the apartment from the moment I walked in the door.   Super friendly and easy to chat too.  He did a great job setting the mood for a visitor.  From offering fresh watermelon when I arrived to playing “hit the road again” music as I was packing up, I’ll look this host up again no doubt."

Small little touches, very clean, and overall lovely. Had all the amenities we needed.. perfect place for a quick visit. Carlo was quick to respond to any questions. I will definitely book again."

The space is a bit small for 3 persons, but it is at a very convenient neighborhood. The room is very clean and chic, we can tell the host has good taste. 
However, before the check out date, the host asked us to bring our own garbages to the basement which we don’t actually quite understand since we paid for cleaning fee… 
Overall I’d recommend this place to stay at the heart in NY."

Carlos (Eduardo's) place is exactly as described: NY style small, very nicely decorated and very central. It has everything you need, great bed, warm shower, fluffy towels and good wifi. It is noisy (bedroom window streetside) as was expected so bring some ear plugs if you are a light sleeper. Lots of nice restaurants around 9th avenue. Communication was good and quick. I would definitely recommend."

I stayed at this lovely Airbnb for three days and truly wished I could have stayed for my entire trip.
Ivy and Carlos were incredibly kind and welcoming, which made the experience even more special. Their check-in instructions were clear and detailed—especially helpful in downtown New York, where everything can feel a bit overwhelming at first.
The apartment was spotless, beautifully organized, and thoughtfully prepared. Even though the neighborhood is lively with traffic and city energy, the space itself felt surprisingly quiet and peaceful. As anyone who visits New York knows, space can be limited—but this Airbnb offers enough room in both the bedroom and bathroom to move comfortably without feeling cramped.
With so many amazing restaurants just steps away, the location couldn’t be better. I would absolutely stay here again and highly recommend it to anyone visiting the city."

I had an amazing stay here! It was my first time in New York and this experience was so much more than just an Airbnb stay. it truly felt like home.
On top of that, Ivy’s stylish interior design, cleanliness, and service were all at such a high level and very professional.
Eduardo always replied quickly and responsibly, and Ivy was so warm, friendly, and caring. And I really enjoyed every conversations. When I wasn’t feeling well, Ivy made dinner for me, and even the cleaning lady made me homemade soup! Thanks to all of them, I was also able to experience the diverse and energetic culture of NY.
If you’re visiting NY, I truly recommend this Airbnb. I’d love to stay here again. Thank you so much for all your kindness and warm hospitality!💛"

Carlos provided thorough, helpful instructions. Even so it was a bit difficult to get in because the keys required a knack I didn't quite pick up. However, the place was very clean, well appointed, smelled pleasant, and matched the description. Quarters about as tight as you'd expect, but the available space was used well. And you can't beat the location: super convenient to the subway, lots of dining and entertainment options, though you'll need to wade through crowds after shows close. Carlos was a thoughtful, responsible host with a great place. Worth it!"

I had a lovely stay at Maria’s airbnb. The bedroom was cosy & clean, and although the apartment is shared with another guest bedroom and the hosts, it was very quiet at night and I had peaceful sleeps. My only downside was that the local buses into New York from the apartment are infrequent and unreliable so it would take about one hour to commute each way."

I may have had another roommate but I never saw them and they must have been quiet. I had trouble with the keys at first but realized I was using the wrong one the whole time so that was operator error.

The place is in disrepair. Heater cover fell off, no outlet covers, very poor water pressure. The apartment is subdivided so this room has the heater for what was meant for the living room & kitchen, meaning it is super hot. It also means every time the room next door opens or closes its door the wall the bed is on shakes. The address the host listed on the Airbnb webpage is different than the address the host actually provides to you."

The apartment, shared with two other guests was perfect for my short stay. Though the apartment was small (like most in New York) and shared, I hardly saw the other guests and everyone was quiet and respectful. My room was private with a lock on the door. And the fan I needed was readily available right in the room. A new looking Air Conditioner was also installed . Though the room was small, there were two windows in it that looked out to a court yard and tree and it was very quiet. I heard some pigeons cooing right outside the window, a sound I like. Anyone with mobility issues should probably not rent this apartment, however. To open the lockbox, one has to kneel or squat to reach it, and the apartment is on the 4th Floor in a walk-up. The host was readily available which was reassuring since locks in old NY buildings can be finicky, but her instructions with photos was very helpful and I accessed the apartment without much difficulty."

I agree the photos are edited to make this place seem better than what it is. The building, apartment, and furniture are in need of repair. I stayed in the small room and it was just okay. Plug covers were missing, questionable stains. Even with directions, the place was hard to get into (keys/door knobs took force to turn). Huimin was very responsive at all times. The biggest gripe was the apartment being on the 4th floor. There are no elevators in the building whatsoever so keep that in mind for those with luggage. Overall, would not stay here again."

It was horribly hot (even with the window open) with no thermostat in the main area that I could find to adjust. Again, for the price I realize you get what you pay for.

Ms. Sandra was an absolute breath of fresh air and a wonderful host to stay with during my first visit to NYC. Not only was she incredibly polite, but she was also very welcoming. Due to severe weather conditions I was able to request an extra night of boarding immediately and Ms. Sandra was very understanding and accommodating. She also offered me a vest to stay warm as I came unprepared for the New York weather as a delusional visitor from Alabama. The space was clean, quiet, and the house rules were incredibly simple to abide by. As a woman traveling alone for the first time I felt very safe with Ms. Sandra as my host and she made a significant effort to make me feel comfortable. I highly recommended her home and appreciate her kindness greatly, and I know where i’ll be staying the next time I visit NYC.

My stay at Sandra's house couldn't have been better, the room was perfect for one person and even though the floor can accommodate like 5 people, I only shared with one guy that was very nice and respectful. Sandra was flexible enough to accommodate to my needs, I even asked to reduce the incense because I'm allergic and she did right away. She also was so kind to let me stay way after the check out time since my flight was at night. I would definetely go back to this place on my next trip to NYC. As a note, the room is 2 floors up through a narrow stairs, so just take into account if you have big luggage like me. Also the house is only 40 min from midtown, so convenient, and I arrived late at night with the subway and didn't feel unsafe at all. Thanks Sandra!!!

Sandra is a super host who looks after her guests, is easy and nice to talk to, communicative and knowledgeable on the area.

It was great to have use of the upstairs kitchen for snacks and drinks. The house is ideally located just 2-3 minutes walk to the Subway station.

I stayed at Sandra's home for 11 days while preparing for an important exam, and it was exactly what I needed. The place is peaceful, clean, and very comfortable—perfect for focusing on studying. It's also in a great location, just a 2-minute walk to the Q train, which takes you straight into the heart of New York City. There are grocery stores and other essentials nearby, making everything super convenient. Sandra was a thoughtful and responsive host, and I really appreciated her hospitality. I’d absolutely stay here again!

Sandra was a very gracious hostess. The house is an adorable 3 story townhouse in a very quaint side street in Flatbush Brooklyn. I grew up in Manhattan, but I’m not that familiar with the neighborhoods of Brooklyn. If I were younger and hadn’t moved to Florida, this would be a neat place to live.
The subway is only a block and a half away and you’re about 40 minutes to midtown Manhattan and about 20 to Coney Island. The only negative thing I could say was that my room was very tiny. I’m 6 foot two and I felt very cramped. I would love to rent from Sandra again, but I would take one of the bigger rooms next time. For a petite female it would probably be perfect.
Response from Sandra
July 2025
It was a pleasure meeting you Jeffery. Enjoyed our brief talk about music.
Yes, I imagine you must have felt pretty cramped you are a big guy. It was also during a heat wave which must have further impacted. Hope the fans were helpful at least.
The big room is on Airbnb so next time hope it will be available for you.

Highly recommend staying at Sandra‘s house. 
Sandra was very welcoming, helpful when I had questions. But really she had made instructions so clear to begin with that I didn’t have too many questions. 
The house has a very calming quality to it, which makes it perfect for a New York stay. 
I really did feel right at home from the beginning, and that was important to me, because New York is such a beautifully hectic city, and it was really nice to come back to some peace and quiet at the end of the day. ☺️
The room and the common areas were very clean and inviting. 
All in all day was so charming and home-y, and I hope to be back myself one day.
Oh, and the subway stop is right by the house. So convenient. 🤭

Sandra is an attentive and wonderful host. Her entire family is helpful. The accommodation is located in a safe, quiet, and green neighborhood. The house is directly adjacent to the subway tracks Q and B.
There are three rooms of varying sizes on the second floor, which share a bathroom. Two face the street with early sunrises, and one is at the back, facing the train tracks, like the well-equipped kitchen. Sandra is generous and loving, and she wants to make your stay as comfortable as possible, providing every amenity. Unfortunately, I had bad luck with the extremely hot temperatures in the very small front room, despite the provided fan. That was unfortunate. The other larger and beautiful rooms, especially the rear room, seem more suitable for hot weather.

My week at Sandra’s place was perfect! I didn’t know what to expect in the neighbourhood but I loved the surroundings and the vibes of the Flatbush area. Sandra and her family are very polite and welcoming, people with great energy. I had my private place to work remotely, which was quiet and peaceful. I was able to cook my meals and use the kitchen, which was ideal to keep myself on my diet. There’s a gym nearby that accepts temporary plans with no contracts (and the owner is super friendly as well). There’s also a big park a few blocks away. There are other guest rooms in the floor but honestly I did not see much of the other guest and had no problems sharing the same bathroom. The laundry place is right by the corner of the street and I was able to do my laundry easily. I will always have good memories of my stay in Brooklyn and I expect to come back to Sandra’s place in the future some day. I can only appreciate her hospitality and the kindness of the people from the region.

I loved my time at Sandra’s house. I felt right at home. And with it being the first time visiting the US I’m so grateful I chose such a safe place to first land. 
The room is cozy. The bathroom and kitchen clean and easy to use. 
The location is great for solo travellers. You have everything you need locally - food stores to cook at home and restaurants/cafes to eat out if you like. And the train station is only a minute or two walk away so getting home late at night alone felt safe as well. 
Manhattan is about a 30 min train ride which did not bother me at all. It was nice to be able to go into the city when I wanted to and then be in a quieter suburb for sleeping. Catching the subway was a novelty being from Australia too so it never got old! 
Sandra was also very helpful with communication and directions. 
The room, kitchen and bathroom is on the top level so you have plenty of privacy. 
I would definitely recommend staying at Sandra’s place.

Sandra was a superlative host and went FAR above and beyond making my Father’s first trip to New York City both memorable and pleasurable.
I first booked this trip over a year and a half ago for May of 2024. Unforeseen circumstances forced me to delay the trip by a year and Sandra was patient and understanding while I sorted it out and rebooked me for the stay a full 12 months later than the initial intention. 
Additionally, due to a change in the NYC Air Bn’B regulations, she was forced to cancel my reservation while the paperwork was sorted out. During this ordeal, she was also extremely helpful as she gave me a refund but held my time-frame until it was possible to resubmit my deposit for the room. I am very grateful for this degree of courteousness.
Upon arrival, she was so friendly and welcoming and this meant a lot as my Father is a pensioner on his first foray across the Atlantic and does not speak English. He could not have felt more at home in his accommodations as it was very

Beautiful, classic house with many characteristic elements from more than 100 years ago.  Atmospheric/warmly decorated with a clear personal touch from a particularly friendly Sandra.
Thanks to the silent fan above the bed, it was wonderful to sleep despite the heat. Kitchen and bathroom excellently equipped, the only downside was the absence of a coffee machine or perculator. 
I would go back to this address on a future visit.

Staying with Sandra was a great experience, pleasant, quiet and undoubtedly left a taste of more.
The communication with her was excellent from the first second to the end!  High availability, warm, caring and motherly attitude, with a real sense of goodwill and concern for the guests.
Sandra was always welcoming, attentive and willing to help, even with the little things. 
For example, when I was looking for a convenient way to Central Park and the route Google suggested was cumbersome and long, she gave me simple and wise advice that saved time and unnecessary detours, all out of genuine concern.
The cleanliness was very high - the room is clean, tidy and pleasant, the kitchen is clean and well-equipped, and it was always clear that it was important to her that everything be well-maintained and that nothing be missing.
The neighborhood itself is very inviting and central in Brooklyn. 
The train station is very close, about a 4-minute walk, trains pass frequently, and accessibility is excellent. 
There's a supermarket nearby and everything you need within walking distance.
I highly recommend staying with Sandra!!!
A place that feels safe, pleasant, clean and managed with heart and with a lot of thought and soul in every detail.
This is definitely my place for next time.
Thanks for everything, Sandra. Thanks to you, the visit to New York has become a great experience.

Sandra is friendly and accommodating. She was happy to arrange an early-morning check-in for me, which was very important to me as I take an overnight flight from my country. I could tell that security and the well-being of her guests is very important to her.
The house is located in Prospect Park South, which is a great neighborhood. It's very safe and you're literally a two-minute walk from the Cortelyou Subway Station on the ""Q"" line with easy access to Manhattan. There's a Key Foods, the Food Co-op, numerous delis and a couple of pharmacies, all within easy reach.

Thanks to Sandra and her listing, I was able to fulfill my dream of living in New York for two weeks, but without spending a fortune on a hotel in Manhattan.
Sandra is a very helpful and very kind person, she always responded quickly to my doubts and although I do not speak English very well, we always had the opportunity to talk and discuss. 
The house is about 300 meters from the Q line and about 800 meters from the B line, with which you can reach Manhattan in 20 minutes and Times Square in 30 minutes. 
And then traveling by subway under the Manhattan Bridge from which to admire the beauty of the city is priceless! 
The house literally has everything, spare bedding, towels, iron, hair dryer, ceiling fan and a nice large fridge. 
The neighborhood is very quiet, although every now and then I've noticed some strange people, but I know it's part of the city. 
The times I've checked in late, I've always felt calm and safe.

I was there for business for 2 weeks, I am a New Yorker who has relocated out of state, so it was fun to be in a part of the city that was unfamiliar to me. Would recommend for business or pleasure. Quick express train to Manhattan. I was at my office in Flatiron in about 30 min each morning.
Sandra is a lovely person with a beautiful home. Excellent stay.

Couldn't recommend this Airbnb more. Incredibly convenient for the subway - literally 2 minutes around the corner from Cortelyou Road, so very easy to pop up to Manhattan or down to Coney Island. Felt very safe - some beautiful houses in the nearby areas. Great selection of shops and restaurants just minutes away from the property. The house itself is absolutely beautiful - very tastefully decorated. My room was the smallest of the available, but there was lots of storage so it never felt cramped. Sandra is delightful, and never felt in any way intrusive. Full marks, would love to come back.

It was the perfect room/neighborhood/host for me! Sandra and Carey were very friendly and gave me the impression I could  always come to them with any questions. They welcomed me with open hearts but did never intrude my privacy. Most of the time I had the whole upper floor (3rd) to myself and could use the kitchen and bathroom whenever I wanted. The room was clean and the neighbourhood very calm. I slept like a baby in this comfortable bed. Also the flat is located right next to a subway station with a direct line to manhattan. It takes around 40-45min. to go to manhattan by subway. The neighbourhood also felt safe and there were a lot of stores and food opportunities in the area. So all in all a perfect experience! Thank you so much Sandra and Carey <3

I booked this place largely off of positive reviews and unfortunately did not have the positive experience others have raved about. 
The place is clean and properly listed, but my experience with the host made this stay very unpleasant. Notably, there was an incident where I had gone to sit in the unoccupied room next to my bedroom. The door was open and I had not realized it was considered off limits. Sandra was very upset with me despite my immediate apology and I felt scolded over an honest mistake. It was a wildly unpleasant exchange that felt very disproportionate. 
Additionally worth noting, there are a lot of security cameras in the house and in the area where you stay. Comfort with being recorded will vary guest to guest, I did not really like them. 
Overall I would say this is not much of a “home away from home,” it’s being a guest in someone’s home, which is fine but not the experience I thought I was paying for.
Response from Sandra
April 2023
Gabrielle booked this accommodation knowing that there were security cameras in public places. She relayed that she did not like having cameras in a place where she was staying because “I don’t know you and I don’t know what you may do with the foootage”. I then reminded her that the security cameras were listed hence I was concerned that she would have booked a stay in a place with cameras. She did not have a house robe so I loaned her a coverup. However that did not suffice. She requested that I turn off the cameras or “cover them up” I told her that I would not do that and suggested that she contact AIRBNB about her concern of the security cameras - that perhaps she could be assisted with finding accommodations that would suit her better. Whether or not she contacted Airbnb I do not know because she remained for her full booking period.
There was another incident. Gabrielle began to “hang out” in another bedroom that she did not book and was not listed as a space for her use. The room has a bed and a living room area and was being prepared as another listing. She was found “hanging out” in this space and upon enquiring about why she was utilizing the room she stated that “I didn’t see anyone using the space so I figured I could use it , but I didn’t use the bed I just sat on the sofa -my bad”.
I attempted to explore with her if there was something on my part that could do in the future to make it clear that the space was not a shared public area - she stated that “ you should have told me during orientation ”. I then asked her to not use the space going forward.
I have been hosting for a long time Gabrielle, and never have I had a guest behave in the way you did. It is my hope that in the future when you are booking a place you will keep in mind what makes you uncomfortable eg no security cameras - and that you make a conscious effort to stay within the parameters of the booking. I gave you the benefit of the doubt about utilizing a space that you did not book when in fact it has been very clear to others that a bedroom with a sofa is not a place to “hang out” whether or not the door is open or closed.
Also the way in which you described my interaction with you is absolutely not my style. It is rather a pity that you would state such an untruth"

The place is very close to the subway and the neighbourhood is peaceful. Clean bathroom, helpful hosts. There are a few house rules which are quite fair.

The house had a couple other people staying in it, which made it feel active and lively, but was still quiet from my room. In a great neighborhood too. Hope to return next time I spend a night in NY."

I can not rave enough about how great Tahimi place was. This was my first time staying in an Airbnb and it exceeded all my expectations. This was definitely worth paying for rather than staying at an overpriced hotel in Times Square. The bus is only a 6 minute walk and it takes you straight to Times Square. The neighborhood is very family oriented and friendly I even became friends with one the neighbors. I’m a really big clean freak so it’s always hard for me to feel comfortable in a space that isn’t mine but you can tell Tahimi takes pride in her space. It honestly felt like I had our own studio apartment. Everything was clean, organized, modern and updated. Tahimi honestly out did a lot of the hotels I have stayed at! She had every amenity ready from umbrellas, to shower caps, to coffee/ tea, lotion, body wash, toothbrush/ toothpaste, etc you name it and she had it. Even the bed was extremely comfortable I felt right at home! I will definitely be staying here again.

tahimi and the unit is really great! Everything very clean, well set up, thoughtfully put together. Bed sheets and pillow were so so comfy, bed itself was nice too. Really great bathroom with special heating in there included. Who doesn't love some good heat agter a shower. Smaller than I though, but I didn't care I new it was small to begin with and quality is more important anyhow. Tahimi was responsive, kind, and helpful throughout. Thank you, Tahimi!"

The room was spotless, and communication was excellent, it honestly felt just like a hotel room. I really loved everything about my stay.
The only minor issue was that the window A/C unit left small gaps on the sides, so some cold air came in, especially when it was chilly outside. But that wasn’t a big deal at all.
Overall, it’s in a great location, the neighborhood feels very safe, and I’d definitely recommend staying here."

Very comfortable room, comfortable bed with quality sheets and towels, we really appreciated the presence of a small refreshment corner with water, coffee pods and tea, in addition to the presence of a microwave oven that on some occasions was very useful for heating ready meals after returning tired from long days in NY. Small shops and bakeries and restaurants in the street just above the house were really convenient, while the bus stop is in the street just below, facing a breathtaking view of the NY skyline. We thank Matt because he has always been very kind and quick to help us with any small unforeseen event or need.

The bath/shower is not properly cleaned as there is black mold on shower door and on ceiling plus very dusty vent. The cleaning fee is not being used to clean and maintain the place.
It is in the 4th floor as described, you do share the apartment with others including the restroom. It is good enough to sleep and leave the next day."

The location of the house is very convenient. You can walk 20+min to the Metropolitan Museum. It takes 5 minutes to walk to a relatively large supermarket. It is only a 3-minute walk from the 86th subway station of Line Q. But this is the stairs on the fourth floor. If you have large luggage, it is not recommended to stay here. There was no air conditioner when we first checked in. Huimin responded to us quickly and solved the problem the next day."

This place has a great location and affordable price. Its 2 blocks from the Q Line entrance. Even if you don't feel comfortable with the subway, there is a decent amount of GOOD restaurants and bars that are within walking distance. Although it was affordable, there were certain amenities that you still expect to be in functioning order that need maintenance. The majority of outlets in our room did not work, the smell of someone smoking from one of the other apartments would drift into the room daily, and the door knob to front door can easily detach if you turn it in the wrong direction, locking you in. The 2x2 notecard with tiny print is the only warning that this occurs. Even after it was fixed, it still would not open the door reliably, making coming and going an anxious experience of whether you will be locked in for the day. On the plus side, there was a Heater/AC unit in the window, which helped control the constant fluctuation of temperature."

The actual address was different from what I originally booked, but only a block away so that wasn't a huge deal. The A/C didn't cool the room and I had missed the detail that the unit was a 4th floor walk-up, so that was unexpected. The listing said room with a patio, but I never saw a patio (unless it was the rooftop, to which I never went)."

Good place to stay at for a few days. It's close to a station to get to the other areas of Manhatten/New York. The apartment is divided into 3 areas (2 rooms + one person living in the hallway) which was a little weird at first because you always walk past another person to get to your room. 
The AC in our room worked perfectly and the bed was really comfy. Unfortunately there was  webbing all over the upper parts of the walls, which could have received an extra wipe beforehand. Otherwise nice and convenient."

Overall it was a good stay. Location was nice and was close to the subway. Pay attention to the address she gives you in the message - that's the right one. I walked to the one that was originally provided at first, which was only a block away, but it was really hot outside so it was sad to have to turn around. Also the key/lock combos are a little different than described, and the front door of the building is finicky, so getting in was a bit of struggle until I could figure it out. For me, the AC was perfect and kept the room chilled"

Everything was as described. Jay is very friendly and responds quickly. The accommodation was great, I felt totally comfortable. The surroundings are also great. The subway is right around the corner and you can get everywhere by train. 
On my next vacation to New York, I will book this place again :-)

Overall a good stay. Our room was clean and tidy, the bed was comfortable. It was a very convenient location as well as a safe area. Everything we needed was within walking distance, but it is also a very busy area so you can hear a lot of traffic and conversations from the window. Only negatives was having to share one bathroom between 2 other couples, and also one towel between two of us. Jay was a friendly host."

Happy with our stay! Communication was great, flexible and easy. 
The place matches the description very well; you share bathroom and kitchen with other guests in a normal, residential building. The area is safe and calm. New York is in general expensive and taking that into account, the price matches what you get."

Very walkable to public transpo - great views just a few minutes walk too! Even though the bathroom was shared, it still felt very private and peaceful. I had a lot of questions when I checked in and Luz was able to answer all of them with easy recommendations! 10/10 stay would definitely stay here again if I need to come back to NJ/NYC!

The North Bergen location worked well as a home base, with convenient access to Manhattan via public transit. I also appreciated how peaceful the neighborhood was, which made it easy to rest and recharge. Overall, this was a pleasant and comfortable stay, and I’m grateful for the hospitality.

Everything was straightforward and easy to understand, which made my stay stress free. It's perfect for solo travelers, and the convenience of being so close to New York City is a huge plus just a quick trip down including the bus stop not even being a 2 minute walk from the stay. I thoroughly enjoyed my time there and would definitely book again. Highly recommended (:

Very convenient to NYC. The room and bathroom were very clean. I rented this room since ‘dedicated bathroom’ was noted on the listing but then it was also described as ‘shared bathroom’ in the details paragraph which I did not read carefully.  Like another reviewer said, I was under the impression this was one of two bedrooms in a house, and not one of several. That said, when I was there it was quiet and without lots of other renters and I did not have trouble accessing the bathroom when I needed it."

The room was clean, and good if you are just there to sleep and not spend much time. I didn't realize it would be a boarding house before staying. It was a little inconvenient sharing a bathroom with 5-6 other people. The bathroom also had some noticeable mold near the ceiling from a previous water leak which I am highly allergic to, but did not complain as it wouldn't have been fixed in the short time I stayed there. Pack light if staying here because the stairs to get up to your room are made for tiny people with no luggage. Overall it was fine and an alright stay for the price."

If you're visiting NYC, the NJ Transit bus gets you to Port Authority Bus Terminal in about 20 minutes, where you can connect to the MTA. It’s easier than it sounds and works out well.

Luz was good host, responded to messages promptly, even with different time differences. 
Place was easy to find bus stop nearby. The room was very spacious. Had access to coffee machine and water which was great. 
A microwave would have been handy to have access to as there’s no access to a kitchen in this listing.
Place has a dryer and washing machine in basement for extra cost of $10. Detergent provided. 👍🏽
Shared bathrooms are kept very clean. Good place to start my New York trip. 
Loved the door security/entrance features to the house and the bedroom.
If you have a large suitcase be prepared to get creative taking it up and down the rather narrow staircase. So pleased I’ve been learning to lift weights. 😄
Would recommend this place to NJ bound travelers."

Reported that the shower drain was clogged and host fixed it the same day. The place is calm, soothing, and feels at home. Free all day breakfast turned out to be a life saver...
Our only challenge (disclaimer: This same feature might be common among hotels in the same area. Since it was my first time in NYC I can't say that this particular hotel had the issue) would be no sound proofing. So if you're a light sleeper, do bring ear plugs and problem's solved.

Stay was just as expected from description, VERY small space but worked for what we needed on our 2 day trip. Check in instructions very clear and easy. Host was very thorough in explaining the procedures and even provided links to make it easier. Shower was clean. Location was great, right by Penn Station!"

A group of boys came into the building at 3AM clapping, yelling slurs, and stomping. They were also throwing food all over the stairs. Because I was unable to contact the host, and so I had to confront the rude guests myself. I knocked on their door and told them off, and how I had already recorded and reported them to Airbnb, and they retreated. This is a fantastic place to stay, but just understand that you will have to deal with problems like these on your own, as there is not a 24/7 phone line to contact the host/groundskeeper.
Other than that, amazing location, Anthony Bourdain's favorite pizza place is right around the corner, as well as a cheap convenience store, and restaurants/bars. This listing is perfect for two people that plan to be on their feet for the majority of the trip. No common space, however there are basic living amenities, and comfy beds. When they are awake, the hosts are very responsive and reasonable. Incredible value for the location and quality."

It has a perfect location—peaceful and walkable. The room is really small; I wouldn’t recommend it for two people. The Wi-Fi doesn’t work well for more than sending simple messages, so I’d suggest getting a good cellular plan. Overall, you get what you pay for. I would definitely recommend this room if you are a solo traveler on a low budget."

good stay for a good price,  literally the bare minimum but it's more than enough for a trip to spend the daytime exploring NYC and have a place to crash and shower.

I recommend it if you travel alone or as a couple."

Koichi's place was the perfect spot for a few days in NYC. It's small but that isn't weird for NY. There was enough room for a chair (which was imperative since you couldn't sit upright in the lower bunk), a small refrigerator, a microwave, a sink (key since there is a shared toilet) and a little plugin kettle (which was lovely as I brought some tea with me). The floor needed a sweep but besides that it was perfect for the time I needed it for. Quieter than other places I've stayed. Thank you!"

It's a small room, perfect for visiting New York. It is located in the center, close to everything. It's quiet and clean. The toilet and shower on the landing are not bothersome, it was always clean and available.
On the other hand, the bunk bed is wooden, different from the one in the photo, and seems really unstable. It moves a lot when someone is on top and gives the impression that it could break. It looks like a child's bed, it's not strong enough for two adults! Other than that, if we don't move, we sleep well.

I am giving a 3-star review because I was not made aware until I arrived in NYC that I would be sharing the apartment with another AirBnb guest. My understanding from the listing was that I would share the space with Reka. However, during the week I was there, 2 different male guests stayed in the apartment. I wouldn't have booked if I had known this. For some solo female travelers, staring an apartment with an unknown man is a safety concern. I found Reka a bit dismissive when I contacted her about this. I think the listing needs to be more transparent."

Reka’s place was a great stay for my few days in ny. the apartment is full of greenery and has a super lived in, cozy vibe. the room was simple but clean, with a closet and plenty of storage to get settled in. it was great having a kitchen to make tea in the morning, she has really cool ceramics. the neighborhood is quiet, walkable to a lot nearby and easy get to most places, not super close to the subway but I made use of the buses a lot during my stay.
The downstairs area has one other bedroom and the bathroom is shared between the two rooms, I had no issues and the other guest was super nice and respectful. 
Would highly recommend Reka’s place as your home base in new york."

What a little gem, right near Tompkins Square Park. 
Reka's place was so homely, the bed was super comfy and the coffee delicious! It was really quiet, and the lift was a plus that you don't get with many places in NYC. It was great not having to lug my luggage up multiple flights of stairs. Oh, and I loved her plants :)"

It felt like the best part of town and very great place too with plants and AC that saved me during the heatwave! Super highly recommend if your in the city to explore and need a cozy spot to rest and enjoy NYC!"

Communication was proactive. The owner sent me a message that the fob/key could be picked up at the small grocery around the corner. A bonus was I was able lock my bicycle in the rear courtyard of the building - so I had no concerns of having my bicycle stolen. Note that I had to carry my bike up one flight of stairs to reach the courtyard level.  Note also that the bedroom door doesn’t lock - I had no concerns about that but some people might.
Response from Reka

Hi Tom- thanks for your review and glad you enjoyed your stay. Just wanted to clarify the bedroom door does lock from the inside, so there is a privacy lock. But it’s actually illegal in NYC to have a key lock on the outside of a bedroom door, as it’s a safety concern in case of a fire. Otherwise I definitely would have them on the doors."

I stayed two nights at Reka’s home in the East Village and had a wonderful experience. The room was private, quiet, clean, and had a very comfortable bed. Although the bathroom is shared, I never saw or heard the other guest, so it felt completely private. The space was simple but thoughtfully equipped with everything you might need. The room has air conditioning, though I didn’t use it—I kept the window open, and even then it was surprisingly quiet with minimal street noise.
Reka is a warm and welcoming host, an excellent communicator, and a delight to chat with. She offers just the right balance of privacy and independence while also being available to answer questions or provide helpful suggestions about the city. I felt very safe and comfortable throughout my stay.
I would absolutely stay here again on my next visit to New York City."

Pete’s diner is a must for breakfast/lunch/dinner. We ate here regularly. The apartment room is super cozy, so many extras that dave has installed. Mini fridge, coffee machine with coffee pods, tea, hot chocolate m, Ferrero Roche. Smart TV, Netflix, Amazon Prime. The room itself was unbelievably warm and cozy. To spend long days in the freezing December/January weather and then come back here, it was bliss🥰. Shared bathroom again was spotless. Also a shared kitchen, with plenty of usage space if required. Dave is an amazing guy. Always available for any questions, or to offer any advice. We had the best time. And Sunnyside, Queens is hands down the best place to stay in NYC. We can’t wait to return!!! Thanks Dave ☺️"

We've been at David's place for more than two weeks and had a really good time there. We weren't there to work but it's still really cool to have this second little room, the small fridge is also very convenient since we didn't want to go to restaurants for every meal. Even though the bathroom is shared, we never waited long for our turn. The area is great to visit, Manhattan is 15min away with the line 7, and since Manhattan can be very crowded and loud, it was good to go back to a quieter place after a long day. There's a cool coffee called Moa Coffee on the way to the subway station. 
We highly recommend David's place!"

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, 10/10.
This accommodation was an excellent choice for a trip to NYC. The location isn’t on Manhattan, but just a short distance away — about a 5-minute walk to the elevated train station, and you can be in the center of Manhattan in roughly 25 minutes. The neighborhood has everything you need: grocery stores, restaurants, cafés, fast food places, bars, and pubs. Plus, Queens itself is full of things to discover.
The room was outstanding — very comfortable bed and all the amenities (towels, toiletries, hairdryer, electric kettle, safe, huge LED TV with soundbar, private fridge). Shared spaces (bathroom, kitchen) were also clean and problem-free.
The host was excellent — attentive, regularly checked in, and made sure I had everything I needed. Truly thoughtful and caring."

Petra was an amazing host! She was so sweet and accommodating!! She offered me a scarf because it had been snowing and she made us coffee in the mornings. One of the days we were there, it had snowed and we were going to stay in and she encouraged us to still go out and do a little bit of sightseeing which was so nice of her to do because we wouldn’t have seen how beautiful the city looks with the snow!!"

This was my first time visiting NYC, and I honestly couldn’t have asked for a better experience. The location was perfect—just a quick 4-minute walk to the subway—making it super easy to get around. The host was incredibly welcoming and always happy to answer any questions I had. The room looked exactly like the photos, and the shared spaces, especially the bathroom, were always spotless. On top of that, it was such a relief to find a place that didn’t break the bank. I’m already looking forward to planning another trip and staying here again. Can’t wait for future visits! Do not miss out!

Beyond that, as much as it was a shared space she allowed us to use it completely uninterrupted. The place was spotless and as stunning as the pictures! Omg they all came out so well!

We had a great stay and really enjoyed this place. The space was clean, comfortable, and exactly as described in the listing. The host was responsive and made check-in and check-out very easy. The location was convenient and quiet, which made it easy to relax after a long day. We’d definitely stay here again and would recommend it to anyone visiting the area. Just two things that needs to be considered are 1) there is one washroom shared among 3 rooms and so weekday mornings might be a little bit of a challenge and 2) the rooms I stayed in is relatively smaller than the other two rooms but was priced exactly the same as the other rooms. 
Overall, amazing place to stay."

This location was very good and affordable compared to New York City. The bus stop is literally a two minute walk which was perfect and a 15 minute bus ride to New York City Port Authority bus terminal, and that connects you to the subways. The room is small and only fits two people like the description. I don’t mind it but if you don’t like small spaces, I wouldn’t recommend the restrooms are shared so I would bring sandals that way you don’t have to step around. Overall, it was a good day and there was shower gel provided in case you forgot definitely worth the price if you’re on a budget. Instructions were very easy and clear. Thank you for a great time."

The room is a bit small for two of us to be honest, but hey, we chose it coz we have to save. The room is however not fully conceal from the noisy from the road. We still could sleep at night with no issue coz the area is very quiet at night.
The kitchen is full and complete. Superb.
We wish if it could have washing machine and dryer. Having said that, laundry is stone throw away.
Supermarket is also very near. We get all we need here. 
The best part we can enjoy the beautiful of Manhattan from this side, day and night."

Pros: 
- very central location. You can walk anywhere, the metro is close and you also have an airport shuttle in the next street 
- Paula is very responsive so communication is smooth 
- flat was very clean (always nice!)
Do note: 
- you will need to sleep with ear plugs as the room is directly on the street. 
- flat is on the first floor with no lift (not an issue for me with just a carry on)
- check in time is pretty late (after 4pm) with no possibility to store luggage before or after check out.

A place very well connected to the city and the subway. Highly recommended.

The place was clean & the host was communicative, but two things were problems for us. The big issue was that the place stinks of air sprays and strong perfumes. It was so intense that we felt sick from it (and I'm used to those things from travel). (The sad thing is that she probably doesn't know that synthetic scents, frebreeze, and all those sprays & plug-ins are cancerous & cause infertility, etc.) The place was fine. The area was where we needed to be."

Valentin's place was very clean, and a 10-minute walk to the train into Manhattan. It's perfect for a quick stay where you'd mostly be out, and just need a place to sleep and shower. Great little kitchen that I didn't need to use; perfect to eat last night's leftovers. The neighborhood felt fairly safe; I had no issues coming back around 10pm-12am. The room itself had solid basics, and a fairly comfy medium-firm mattress. The hot water temp and water pressure in the shared bathroom was excellent for a winter stay, when the outside weather was 20-40F. The address I received initially was different than the one I received closer to the trip; I was told that was due to an Airbnb error. That made my commute into Manhattan slightly longer, but I was able to adjust. Our communication had a rough start, but Valentin's responsiveness smoothed over a few small issues."

A solid place to stay for a quick night before a flight. Thin walls means that if you're neighbor is talking at night, you're gonna hear it, so bring ear plugs. That's the only major knock against it."

The space is very open and the kitchen and restroom have everything you would need. The bedroom is spacious and bright with a very comfy mattress. The area is very safe and quiet with lots of families and young people.
Overall the stay was amazing and the host was very friendly and proactive. I will definitely try to re-book next time I’m in NYC."

Smaller size room with minimum open space as bed occupies most of it.   Room has a single window,  when opened you're able to touch the wall of another adjacent apartment building, making daylight non-existent.  Quality of bedding extremely low,  firm inexpensive mattress making sleep uncomfortable, same goes for pillows and blanket. 
Communication with host has to be in writing via airbnb only, host demonstrated negative attitude when I called contact number.  All written communication with host were more of a template responses including final message asking not to leave any lesser than a five star feedback. 
The only positives going for this property is a quite location."

Had a great stay at the Shoreham. It seemed that there was always someone downstairs, the location really was outstanding, and, though it may seem small, the staff brought towels for us very quickly. The room was small but bigger than expected and fitted our needs: a place to sleep, shower, and keep our stuff. Would recommend to anyone looking for a more lowkey housing option when visiting New York.

Our room was small but very clean and the bed and pillows were comfortable. We were able to check in early but they will also store your luggage before and after check-in/check-out. My only suggestion is to charging ports for electronic devices.

This hotel was decent for the price, and the location was solid and super close to everything you want to be near. The room was fairly nice, but lacked common features like a microwave, fridge, and night stands on both sides of the bed. The bathroom was far smaller than it appeared, and there was really only room to stand at the sink (which was the size of an airplane sink.) The shower was pretty nice, but the hot water only lasted for about 4 mins and then turned cold (great water pressure tho!) The TV (streaming and cable) along with wifi didn’t work, so had to rely on hotspot which wasn’t a super big deal but would have been nice to have some WiFi. Other than that, this place was a solid place to get some good sleep after exploring the city."

Pros: Excellent location, fantastic walkability to subway stations and midtown attractions. Quiet room which was great! Staff were really friendly (always greeted us and tried to help us with any needs). Daily cleaning service which was lovely. Downstairs had a mini kiosk with coffee/beverages and snacks and an adjacent fine dining restaurant! 
Cons: Lots o’ stains (carpet, curtains, cloth portions of wall). Needs an overhaul. Found a make-up stain and stray black hair (definitely not ours) on one of our bath towels. Cigarette smell on our floor but not in the room itself. Window did not seal fully but curtain at least helped keep the cold out. Phone didn’t work despite maintenance coming to work on it (though speakerphone did work!). No ice bucket and then when I asked for one it was dirty :/ 
To sum it up — some cleanliness/maintenance issues… BUT overall we loved the location and convenience and we were happy with our stay and how we were treated by the staff :)

Location, location, location! If you’re looking for the best location is this one. No doubts. The hotel in general needs maintenance, the rooms look outdated like the lights don’t turn off when you out, the doors doesn’t looks pretty secure, and the elevator is old but at the end you can rest pretty fair after walking around NYC the whole day. The bathroom is nice, I went alone, so you might have to consider there’s only one sink but is pretty cool for one. It called my attention the gym didn’t have  treadmill. The personal is nice in general. I only received complimentary water when I checked in and I asked the next day and said “they don’t have it”. They didn’t have bathrobes available, I mean in the middle of winter when you’re freezing after taking a bath, it would be nice. I would suggest they can give you some maps or suggestions if you’re coming for tourism of the first time. At the end, it could be better but is fair for the price. Location is everything.

I booked a 1 king bed, which looked spacious in the photos. Once we checked in, the room seemed SO much smaller. I realized even the bed was much smaller, like a full size bed. There was hardly any room to put our luggage. You basically had to walk around the bed because the room was so small. Something didn’t seem right, so I re-read the listing. 
Only when I complained, did they look to see if there were other king bed rooms. Then they told me they didn’t have any more king beds! So why do you overbook?! I asked for a partial refund since I wasn’t getting what I signed up for. Thankfully, the staff were kind and upgraded us to a suite room. 
While I am very grateful for the customer service, I do feel annoyed that they initially thought they could pull a bait and switch on us. My friend is the type of person who wouldn’t complain, and that would be incredibly unfair to those who put up with it but still pay for it.

the location was super convenient for sure. i found their front desk employee Flor to be incredibly helpful when i was checking in and wanted to switch rooms, as the original room smelled heavily of mold. she got me into a new room right away. 
there was no clear disclosure about having to pay an additional fee for wi-fi . i was traveling with my service dog and ultimately needed to pay an additional daily fee to keep a mini fridge in my room, whose cost was also not advertised, but that’s okay as well. 
my biggest note / feedback is that generally the hotel front desk staff has clearly not been trained by their superiors to be solution oriented. one small and silly example is that i asked for a plastic fork and spoon my last night there to eat food in my room and the gentlemen on duty refused to give me one, even though it was quite clear they were resourced to do so.
other than that, i generally found the front desk staff to be friendly but generally not super accommodating"

Overall The Shoreham is a fantastic deal for the price. Room is comfy, larger than your average NY hotel room, with an amazing location near Madison Avenues, Times Square and Central Park. Great location for new tourists. The only downside is that the room smelled like cigarette smoke and the bed sheets had what seems to be a blood stain. I spoke to the cleaning personnel and they switched them with clean ones, but I had to wait until the following day because I arrive late and there was no one available; plus, you expect your bed to be clean when you arrive after hours of traveling.
Response from The Shoreham Hotel

Thank you, Gersson, for your review. We're delighted to hear that you enjoyed our comfortable rooms and prime location near key attractions. We sincerely apologize for the cigarette smell and the issue with the bed sheets.

Please know that this matter will be addressed with our management team to prevent future occurrences. We truly appreciate your feedback and are committed to transparency and customer satisfaction."

The apartment was lovely, spotlessly clean, and very well located in New Jersey, with excellent transport links into New York City. The bus into Manhattan and the Port Authority was easy to access, and the riverway ferry was a great option too.
The apartment had everything we needed for a comfortable stay, and the pull-out bed was good quality and very comfortable.
We really enjoyed our stay and wouldn’t hesitate to stay here again when visiting New York City. Highly recommended."

We would totally 100% come here again, very beautiful and peaceful neighborhood! The bus is down the block which we used our credit card to pay the times we visited Manhattan. There is several grocery stores around but my favorite was Jersey Market fruits and vegetables nice and humble people. Parker Cafe right across the street is a cozy place to eat and to get coffee. There is also two nice little bars down the street which is very awesome to see, it's like something out of a movie in this neighborhood! Overall beautiful place to stay at. Also the bus from this Airbnb home to the bus terminal (port authority) in Manhattan is about 20 minute ride and charges 4 bucks per person. Very easy to use after using couple times."

I would especially highlight the bed linen and towels, which smelled wonderfully fresh. There’s a store and a few small fast-food places on the street, and we met quite a few locals—one man even showed us the building entrance when we first arrived.

Five stars all around, truly. For a place with a shared bathroom and public spaces this was exceptional. All rooms I interacted with were spotless. Wilder was highly responsive, other guests were polite, it felt quiet and private. It was also close enough to uptown NYC that if I needed to come back, I would probably find it convenient to stay here again."

We had an amazing stay here! The place was spotless. Sheets were clean, blankets were clean. Clean towels, shower and bathroom were spotless. We had needed extra towels he answered within 20 minutes and delivered them same day! He’s very quick to respond when I would message him. Bus stop is not even a 5 minute walk down the street about 20 minute ride to NYC. Beautiful skyline view from the home. This is a shared place with other people! But it was not bad at all and we had no problems.  It will be cold when you first get in your room! But once you turn on the heat in your room it’s perfect. Overall and amazing experience and we will be coming again!! Thank you Wilder!

Excellent stay here. House in quiet and safe area. Clean room, kitchen and bathroom. 4 rooms sharing one bathroom was little annoying after a long day. (There is another separate toilet btw). Close to bus stop which connects to Manhattan very easily. Remember NJ transit is different from MTA. Traffic could be very bad in the morning (before10am) and around 4-6pm so be aware."

Our stay at David and Mila's place was the New York experience we hoped for! David provided thorough instructions and photos on how to reach the BNB which was very helpful. The quiet suburban neighborhood felt right at home and was walking distance to many great restaurants and markets. So long as you get the maps right, getting to and from Manhattan takes about 25-30 minutes. The kitchen had all basic amenities. We brewed some hot tea and hot chocolate on our last day and enjoyed the final sips of our trip out on the balcony. Would recommend David and Mila's BNB for those looking for an undisturbed quiet getaway that is still close distance to many attractions. Great stay!"

This stay is for people who want the bare minimum and a place to rest their head for their stay in NYC. I only stayed for two nights and was out for most of those days. The comment that mentioned a “domestic incident” downstairs I will say those tenants were arguing loudly when I arrived around midnight but I couldn’t hear them once I closed my door however you can hear people come and go from the shared bathroom on the second floor. 
While I do feel the pictures feel a bit different than what I walked into, the stay was clean and clear of clutter and good for my short visit and what I needed to do in the city."

This was worth the price. It was a little confusing coming into the building, we weren’t sure where the kitchen was and that was where we were supposed to put our bags. It was behind the door labeled 2,3. It was very clean, the bed linens smelled like clean laundry and the bathroom was attended to daily. There are 3 bedrooms on the upper floor that share the kitchen and the bathroom.  This room was outside of the main apartment and was just alone right off of the stairs. The Astoria neighborhood was a great place to stay because it has so many restaurants walking distance and it’s away from the hustle of Manhattan.  We didn’t spend much time in the room, it was mostly just a place to sleep and shower and it fit our needs. It is also a convenient walk to the train which made commuting so easy."

David was a very responsive host who provided me with enough detail to know where to go and what I needed to do in order to get in. I recommend their place as a convenient location to rest your head before heading to nearby Manhattan but I wouldn’t stay here if you are looking for peace and tranquility as there was a literal domestic incident going on in the apartment below me that was extremely loud and concerning. Could have been a one time thing and really not much the hosts could have done as they weren’t staying in the apartment with me, but just something to keep in mind when comparing listings."

Only a few blocks from Central Park and only a 25-30min subway ride to the lower end of Manhattan. Aleksandr also responded very promptly and was very nice. We met Carla at the apartment and she was very nice. Even though it was a shared bathroom it was kept tidy and even cleaned while we were there. Thank you for letting us stay :)"

Alex and the co-hosts were welcoming and tried to cater my requests. They shared breakfast and desserts with me. Alex from time to time checked in with me to make sure I was okay, and gave me travel suggestions. I was nice talking to him.

Yet, they left space for us to happliy enjoy our light meal in the common area. They took an interest in how they could assist with our plans to be in New York for our <24-hr. whirlwind visit. It was exceptionally helpful to have guidance about parking in the locale, although we were lucky enough to find a spot on the street. We felt very secure and safe at Aleksandr's AirBnB, and very much like the idea of visiting again soon."

My husband and I had the pleasure of staying in this wonderful apartment for 10 days during our honeymoon – and it was absolutely perfect! The place was spotlessly clean and incredibly quiet. Both the room and the kitchen were very well equipped – everything we needed was there.
The host Tony was not only incredibly welcoming and kind, but also had a great sense of humor, which made our stay even more enjoyable.
We truly got to relax and enjoy every moment. The city is magical, and from the very beginning, we felt right at home.
A huge thank to Tony – we would love to come back and highly recommend this place to anyone!"

beautiful private room, we got everything we needed like towels, blankets, netflix, fridge, coffee, water heater, AC and more inside the room. the apartment is nice, got everything you need for living and there are 2 more rooms with guests/renter, which are all sharing one bathroom. 
it is a 10 min walk to the next subway Station which brings you to Manhattan within 15/20 min, very good. (there is No elevator at this subway Station, in case someone needs it.) 
the neighboorhood is safe (we were two women) & beautiful, supermarkets, restaurants, small Shops like Delis are close by, comparatively cheap to manhattan and super for breakfast or dinner. 
Tony was helpful and reachable all the time, he also offered to pick us up by car at the metro station since there was heavy rain.  
we would book again :)"

He had all the accommodations needed for 3 day stay.  We felt safe walking the neighborhood even around 9 pm. The subway was around a 10 to 15 minute walking distance on that same road, no need to divert to another road. The photo on google does not do the front entrance justice as Tony has had the entrance remodeled. This is a place we absolutely recommended. Look forward to booking again in the future."

You never know quite what to expect when you’re staying in a room in someone’s home.  In Anastasia apartment, I felt like a welcome guest and was given the space and privacy I needed to get my work done during the day so I could enjoy the theater in the evenings.  The apartment is exactly as described. It is small and cozy, has all the amenities that you need, and was much better than staying in hotel room."

Anastasia is a responsive host. Her place is safe and good value. The flat is very clean, 5 min walk to the nearest subway. The neighborhood is very quiet. The appartement has two bedrooms the rental and hers. She wasn't there during my stay and her boyfriend kept the door closed so we didn't meet. No noise, no fuss, good if you're traveling on a budget. The only thing to be mindful of is the apartment is on the 4th floor after a steep and narrow staircase. Don't overpack 😉
Overall convenient & safe on a budget. 🙂"

The place is excellent as a launching point to the city. Even though the subway is a couple of blocks away it is rather easy to get around. Hot water takes some time to come out, but everything else was cozy and nice. I didn’t mind the stairs to the fourth floor but if you have big luggage it might be a challenge on the narrow staircase. Great host. Highly recommend it."

First time in Manhattan, I arrived in the middle of a heat wave on a day which NYC hit 100F, for which the AC installed in the room was a life saver.
I liked the personal flair of the room, and it was very clean and comfortable as well. It's a great place for the solo traveler, though I found the the stairs a bit trickier to navigate with my luggage than expected.
The location is very convenient for exploring the various areas of Manhattan."

I choose Anastasia’s accommodation as I only really needed a place to sleep and store my items during the day. The apartment was very clean and easy to find. 
It’s is on the 4th floor, which was not a problem, but you can anticipate a narrow stair way. The apartment itself was exactly as pictured. 
It is within walking distance of Korea Town which I was looking forward to and is one transfer away from the Path train if you are looking to spend a day in NJ. There are lots of restaurants in the area and markets if you want to buy anything to cook in the kitchen later. 
During my stay the host was away for personal reasons but remained in contact at all times and still made me feel very welcomed. She allowed me to check in early which I greatly appreciated so I didn’t have to carry my bags around till check in. 
Overall, I enjoyed my time and would stay here again."

Located on 32nd Street in Midtown, it’s very convenient for visiting attractions, and luggage storage is available. The host communicated clearly and promptly. The room was clean and tidy. In a place like Manhattan where every inch of space is precious, finding such a character-filled place at this price is almost unimaginable. If there’s any room for improvement, it would be the sound insulation—city noise can still be heard at night, so noise-cancelling headphones are recommended for sleeping."

I got Anastasia's place the morning my NYC lodging option suddenly fell through. It's a great place in a great location - convenient! The kids at the playground don't get started until past 8 AM, so I was able to sleep well. You do have to carry your luggage up to the 4th floor, but other than that, she provided an umbrella, a shoe horn (!), and everything I needed. I loved that I was able to cook my breakfast, as I was eating out for all the other meals. She emptied the closet and drawers so I could organize my luggage. She was also kind enough to let me drop off my luggage early, so Anastasia made my first day in NYC easier. I highly recommend the place!"

The only comment to note for those who book this place is that the room is right next to what I think is the engine room. So if you're a sound-sensitive person, it's something to consider. However, if you are not, the truth is that it does not bother or disturb you.  
Highly recommended.

The doorman closed both of the sliding doors and we couldn’t get in with our key through the second door. Waited patiently, knocked, rang the bell, called, nothing for 30 minutes out in the cold. He finally comes out and (probably accidentally) admits he had been looking at us in the cameras but didn’t come out.

Dear Jose, I'm truly sorry for the inconvenience you faced with the sliding doors and the wait outside.

The location was great. It was right next to the metro. It was a smaller holiday inn than others that ive stayed at but in a prime NYC location it does make sense! Rooms were clean and staff was nice. My boyfriend and I got to the hotel late after going out (around 3am) and we had to wait around 5 minutes for a concierge to come downstairs to hear the doorbell we were ringing.

We were really happy with the value of this stay. Hard to beat the price, staying in Manhattan!  Everything was neat and clean, the staff was kind and helpful.  We had a little trouble getting the right temperature (heater was very hot) but figured it out.  It was bitter cold outside, like below 0 with wind chill, so having the room a little too warm was not a bad problem to have!  The bed was comfortable, and we couldn't hear the other guests at all.  Just a note, the rooms and hallways are quite small, so not great if you are claustrophobic, but we were fine. Very happy with our stay."

Cheaper place to stay in a busier area. The room is at an acceptable clean standard but no further. Corner clean and detail areas are missed. HVAC doesn’t respond well and after looking at other reviews, that seems to be common. Room smells (almost like the Indian restaurant on the first floor) not overly awful but noticeable and bothersome enough. Elevator is extremely slow. That said, if you want a hotel that’s as cheap as you can get without danger/ being very dirty, this is a good fit. If you want a clean, quiet place I’d recommend you look elsewhere. (I stay in the city 1-2 nights a week and have been through most of the FiDi area hotels.)

My wife and I enjoyed staying at the Holiday Inn Wall Street which is three blocks from the New York Stock Exchange on the same street.  The receptionist Justine was excellent and handled all kinds of situations.  There is an adjacent restaurant called Ane which has delicious American breakfasts and Indian food for lunch and dinner, plus you get a 15% discount on the breakfast when you stay at the Holiday Inn.  The rooms are relatively small but have all of the essentials.  I would unplug the alarm clock since otherwise it will make a strange sound at an odd time of the morning.  You get a decent view of the office building across the street, but more importantly you are within easy walking distance of the entire financial district and other highlights of downtown Manhattan including the Brooklyn Bridge and City Hall Park.  Fortunately the room temperature can be adjusted to whatever you prefer.

I had a very poor experience during my stay. Throughout the entire night, there was a loud clawing/scratching noise coming from the bathroom exhaust fan area. I was not using the fan at any point.
The noise was persistent and loud enough to keep me awake all night, and I was unable to sleep before a very early 3:00 AM checkout for a flight. I cannot say definitively what caused the noise—whether an issue within the ventilation system or something else—but regardless, it made the room uninhabitable for rest.
Given the impact on my sleep and overall stay, I would not recommend this listing unless the issue is fully resolved.

For my friend’s first visit to NYC, this hotel was perfectly located for doing all the classic touristy things. The staff kindly upgraded us to a more spacious room on the 19th floor, and we really appreciated how quiet the hotel was throughout our stay.
The staff were not only very kind but also impressively efficient—helping with luggage storage and retrieval, late check-in, and more. I was especially impressed by one staff member, Ms. Zaynah. In the middle of a chaotic check-in rush, she somehow managed to help us reclaim our luggage seamlessly. She expertly “played Tetris” with suitcases in the elevator and corridor, let us grab our bags ourselves, and sent us straight up to our room so we could rest immediately—without wasting a single minute. All of this, with a smile on her face the entire time. Truly unbelievable service.

Location. Location. Location. First-time visitor or seasoned New Yorker, you could not ask for a better location. Walking distance to, well, everything that the Financial District has to offer. From the Stock Exchange to 1 WTC, here's your chance to hobnob with NYC's movers and shakers. Architecture, your thing? Luxury shopping? Be WOWED by both in the design wonder that is the Oculus. Pay a visit to the 9/11 Memorial Site and feel the reverence that all of New York holds for the names etched around the perimeter of the Reflecting Pools. 
Despite the scaffolding that temporarily obscures the hotel's façade, the building is easy enough to locate. After a good night's sleep on the most comfortable bed and a quick workout in the fitness center, there'd be nothing more welcome than a long, luxurious shower powered by a most generous shower head. The rooms are small but adequate. With so much to see and do, you won't be spending much time indoors.

We apologize for the temporary scaffolding, and we appreciate your understanding. We look forward to welcoming you back for another memorable stay."

Clean hotel room.  Bed and pillows were good.  It is a no frills kind of place.  Certain areas of the hotel are a bit worn and dated ( the halls, the check in area).  Having said that, if you are just looking for a clean place to rest, close to the financial district, then it certainly serves its purpose.  There is an additional destination fee of $17.21/daily I was not aware of.

very solid place to stay. it is clean, has great air conditioning, and it is safe. the bed is fairly comfortable.
the ""gym"" advertised is a small room in the basement with two treadmills in it. no weights, nothing else. 
the hotel has no ice machine or water fountains or dispensers. 
the system of extending and/or changing your reservation are basically nonexistent, but it's a good place to sleep for as reasonable a price you can find in NYC.

I wish I could write a better review. The location was great, the price was pretty decent, and everyone we interacted with were, at some level, very friendly. However, the biggest issue was that the Airbnb listing 100% said the room had a king-sized bed in it, and it absolutely only had a full bed. The size of the bed was a big feature in picking the room. 
After getting into the room and realizing this, I went to the front desk, who were fairly stand-off-ish and didn't seem understanding or all that eager to do anything about it (hotel was full, but no offer of partial refund, etc.). Moreover, they claimed it was a queen bed anyway (it was not, we had a sewing tape measure handy), and that a queen bed was bigger than a king! Airbnb co-host initially seemed friendly too, but was not very proactive at all in trying to resolve the issue either. If you're ok with whichever room/bed you get after booking, and ok with poor help if you run into issue, this could be the place for you!
Response from Holiday Inn New York City

Dear John, Thank you for sharing your feedback. I'm genuinely sorry to hear about the bed size issue you encountered during your stay.

Convenient location 
Friendly front desk
Unpleasant smell in hallway and room
AC did not work properly 
Had to switch it on and off often and heat came on with burning smell so I turned it off altogether 
Other than that. Some TLC is needed but it did what it was meant to do & price wasn’t too bad

Thank you for sharing your feedback, Siera. I'm glad to hear you found our location convenient and our front desk staff friendly.

My 14yr old son and I stayed here for a 4 day visit to NYC. Great location, many options for transportation, and many walkable stores and attractions. The hotel room has exactly what you need if you’re needing an affordable place to rest and sleep after a long day or site seeing and roaming around the city. The front desk staff were all very friendly and helpful, checking in and out was a breeze. CVS Pharmacy is up the road if you need to buy anything you forgot, grab a slice of pizza at Joe’s also up the street, TJ Maxx is down the street if you need any clothes or extra luggage. We’d also recommend 7th street burgers- also in the same street. We enjoyed our stay and would stay here again.

This was my worst hotel experience ever. First of all this hotel looks big on the outside but trust me when you get inside everything is looks like it’s just squeezed together. It’s smells horrible I don’t know if people be smoking in there but all the building smells very bad. I was supposed to stay there for 5days but I only ended up staying for a night because I couldn’t stand the smell. I messaged the Airbnb host and he told me to talk to the manager or the front desk so that they can give me another or solve the problem but I didn’t do that because I knew that even if they give me another it will also be smelling the same because all the building has the same smell. I told the front desk that I will check out the next day which was 08/01/2025 mind you I checked in on 07/31/25. I asked them if I’m going to get my refund and they told me that I will get my refund for the remaining 4days that I didn’t stay there, the security deposit, and the resort fee. The shower was not even worki"

Awful guest service.  Their policy was no cancellations.  Fine.  The date of my trip changed so I tried to change it online which the site let me do as there was availability.  They refused to accept the change even though it wasn't in their policies.  The worker told me that it was my fault and I should take it up with Airbnb.  I tried but the Airbnb system wouldn't let me communicate with them and then closed my case.  What pisses me off was that, since then, I've received multiple emails from them, thanking me for my stay and telling me that I was a great guest.  That just makes me more annoyed.

Dear Gwyn, I'm sorry to hear about your experience with the booking change. I understand how frustrating the situation must have been, especially when the website allowed changes due to availability.

First off, Jason was a great and responsive host. We had a few kinks while booking and he was very understanding and helped us. Then, when we were going to arrive after midnight, he accommodated the late check in time. The room was very clean and exactly as described. I particularly appreciated the black out curtains...a dark room helps me sleep much better. The bed was comfortable and there was always a small snack at the front desk. The only thing we did not like is because we arrived after midnight and there is no parking on site(which was mentioned in the posting, this was not deceptive in any way) we had a difficult time finding an open parking garage that actually had availability. Having never been to NYC, wandering around at 130am to find somewhere to park wasn't our favorite. HOWEVER, other than Yankee Stadium everything else was within easy walking distance. Can't beat the price. 5/5!"

This was one of the most disappointing hotel experiences I’ve had in over two years of living in New York. When I first entered the room, I found visible mold on the bed, which was disgusting and completely unacceptable from a health perspective. I asked to switch rooms, and while I was moved, the new room was barely functional:
	•	No working outlets (except in the bathroom)
	•	Only one working lamp
	•	TV didn’t turn on due to no power in the room
The hotel offered to move me yet again, but I had four large suitcases, and at that point I felt completely exhausted and unsupported. The staff was dismissive, unhelpful, and even borderline rude, making an already frustrating situation feel worse. I paid nearly $200 a night, which is outrageous given the poor conditions and lack of basic amenities.
I do not recommend this hotel. The rooms are poorly maintained, the service is lacking, and no one should have to deal with mold, non-functioning rooms, or being treated like an inconvenience."

I would consider staying here again, depending on the price. If you’re expecting a great hotel experience, you’ll likely be disappointed. But if you go in with a realistic understanding of NYC accommodations—especially for shorter stays—you’ll probably appreciate the value.
The space was quaint and served my needs for the weekend. However, the plumbing could be improved (slow flushing, clogged sink), though it wasn’t a major inconvenience for me. Housekeeping, on the other hand, could do a better job cleaning the bathroom and nightstands—I noticed visible smudges, hair, and other residue. Thankfully, I had my own disinfectant wipes and air spray, but without them, I would have been frustrated.
Overall, I liked it well enough to consider staying again, but next time, I’d ensure the room is thoroughly cleaned and everything is in working order.
Response from Holiday Inn New York City

Thank you for your feedback. We're pleased to hear that you found value in our accommodations despite the concerns. We apologize for the plumbing and housekeeping issues, which should have been addressed during your stay.

I would go back to the place if I went back to NY.

I must say the location was great. Easy and in the middle of everything, lots of subway stations nearby, Joe's Pizza, many restaurants, cafes, and convenience stores. The room was very clean, the bed was comfortable just a small room and bathroom. The description says taxes are about 18% but it's actually around 22-23% explained by the front desk lady. The people were very nice and polite while check-in, overall it was a great stay."

Well the Holiday Inn was in a perfect location for myself to do all the things I want to do. Staff wasn’t too friendly the room wasn’t the cleanest, and the hidden fees were a little bit of a shocker being that it was an extra $200 on top of what I already paid for my stay. But overall it wasn’t too bad and I could possibly be back again loved the vacation in New York though.

Very good experience. The location is one of the hotel's great strengths: it is meters from Fulton Station, which is huge and very practical. From there you can access several metro lines, which makes getting around the city really easy. In addition, the area feels very safe, even at night, something that was key for us.
As a nice touch, they kindly give you two bottles of water per day, which were picked up at the front desk. The hosts were always friendly and helpful.
The room is small, as is often the case in big cities, but very comforting. The bed, in particular, was very comfortable and allowed us to rest well every day.
Some days they also gave us cookies at the front desk, a simple gesture but it added a lot.
In short, a well-located hotel, in a safe area, with good service and details that make the stay more pleasant. No exaggeration, it's very good, and we definitely recommend it and would choose it again.

NYC hotels tend to have small rooms and lobbies. This was no different. It also shows its years. This is not glamour lodging. However the staff were a delight. Helpful and cheery. The location is great because of the proximity to multiple subway lines. We were going to an event in Brooklyn Heights, and the trip was about 10 mins. The financial district is pretty quiet on the weekend, but there were enough places open. Go to Farida, an Uzbek restaurant, if you want a dining adventure. Walk down to take the free Staten Island ferry and pass the Statue of Liberty.

My stay at this hotel was not as expected. When I arrived, the room was not properly cleaned, and I found two dirty towels on the floor of the bathroom. Additionally, there were no clean towels provided, which was quite disappointing.
I contacted Airbnb to address the issue, and they were helpful in resolving the situation by offering a partial refund. However, I believe that basic cleanliness and attention to detail should be standard for any stay, especially at this price point. I hope the management will take steps to improve the cleanliness and service for future guests."

We had brown water in the shower and tap (because of a broken main pipe), which smelled like sevage, and a blocked shower drain so the water stayed in the tub. The hotel manager changed us to a new room, but that one had a very moldy smell. Staff was very nice though. In the end we did not realize we had to pay heavy tax on arrival so the price you see on airbnb is not accurate. It ended up being much more expensive than other hotels would have been in the area. I cannot recommend at this price.

We needed an affordable place to stay for a short 48 hour trip to NYC. I've stayed at this Holiday Inn previously, so I knew the location would be a hike to our planned activities. The bathroom in our room had some comical features - the bathroom door has a notched spot so that it will open past the toilet and the curved shower rod was bent inward at the center for the same reason. 🤣 There were blackout shades, the bed was comfortable, the room was cool, the TV was fine. There're plenty of places to grab delicious food right there, even on the weekend.

Very clean space. Public transportation is very close and you are in around 20 minutes e.g. at the Times Square.
If you are outside late at night (after 2am), you are basically stranded so you should try to be back earlier. That’s the reason why the location was a little bit inconvenient for me personally.
But most of the must sees are pretty close and it is pretty calm at night too so I can definitely recommend this place."

I also really like the neighborhood because it's not yuppie New York, there are lots of nice little stores around the corner. At the Community Laundromat, a load of laundry costs 3 dollars, and there is very good coffee at Shaky's Juicebar & Cafe. The buses to Manhattan are frequent, a one-way ticket costs 4USD and you can easily pay by credit card. It's quicker to take the express lines which cost the same. It really is a very nice and well connected area. It's worth staying at Odalis :)

Adolfo was very helpful whenever I had questions and always respected my privacy. Overall, I was very satisfied with my stay and would warmly recommend this place."

It was a delight to stay at Hjordys' place, as it was the ideal location for me. I was there to run the New York City marathon and could easily access all the event venues that I was required to attend over the weekend. I would have no hesitation in recommending Hjordys' place and would certainly look to return if I ever came back to New York to run the marathon again!"

Had an excellent stay here! Adolfo was personable and welcoming which made shared spaces no problem at all! The kitchen, bathroom, and bedroom were all incredibly clean with personal touches such as the many happy houseplants. 
Street parking was surprisingly easy and the surrounding neighborhood had plenty of nice places to dine in! This apartment was right next to a bus stop and the ferry to New York was less than 10 minutes by car or bus. 
Overall I'd say that this spot is cozy and charming with a lively cityscape nearby! A good place to rest your head for the night if you plan to visit NYC without having to pay NYC prices."

The home was very clean and I got a good nights sleep.  
One thing I wished I had known before booking was that the common areas were shared with someone who spent the evening in the living room watching television somewhat loudly.  It was awkward and I did not feel comfortable using that space or the kitchen (which you have to walk through that space to get to).
Response from Hjordys
June 2025
Thanks for the feedback! We'd like to reiterate this unit has always been listed as a shared space and the host's primary residence. We urge future guests to expect that he may be home, prepare a meal, or even watch TV on occasion -- but always in accordance with the house rules (see quiet hours)."

I booked this airbnb for 8 days, so far this has been the best experience I have ever had with booking a place to stay. The airbnb was super clean, everything is really well organized. Adolfo was very respectful throughout my whole stay, greeted me and showed me around the place, showed me where I can find what I might need etc. He has some plants in the kitchen that lifted the whole environment, it felt super cosy to be there. Manhattan is just a 10 minute trip away, bus station is right around the corner, buses come every 5 minutes or so. Getting back from manhattan can be hard at first but really easy afterwards, Adolfo does a great job with explaining how the Port Authority bus terminal works. The area surrounding the place is also very safe, there is a really nice park close by where you can see the beautiful manhattan skyline. I spent a couple hours around night time there to chill on a bench and read. Do yourself a favor and book this home. 100% worth it in every aspect.

Chris was a very kind and thoughtful host who put a lot of effort into welcoming me to the space, showing me around and making sure my stay was comfortable. Chris has also done an amazing job with the room, which is very large by NYC standards and has everything you need to enjoy your stay. The area is a peaceful community with lots of families, but also very close to the 7 subway line and lots of great restaurants nearby. It was a joy to stay with Chris and I have no hesitation in recommending Chris’s place to other guests, you will have a lovely time."

For a couple, you will have everything in the room, even if one day it rains, you have an umbrella and many more details that make you enjoy the whole house. If you're a woman, you'll find a comfort that I haven't seen in other Airbnbs. You can put on makeup as if you were at home. It's like your own room. We also needed something and Chris offered to buy it just because we didn't have it, that makes him an excellent host. We highly recommend this place!

The place is about a 10 minute walk from the nearest subway station, but the neighborhood and general area was safe and peaceful. It also has a good amount of restaurants and bars on the main street by the subway. The kitchen itself was nice and clean but I didn't do any cooking myself.
