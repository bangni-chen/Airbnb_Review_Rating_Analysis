## Introduction

This project investigates what separates 5-star Airbnb reviews from lower-rated reviews. The data were scraped from Airbnb listings in Manhattan, New York. The dataset includes reviews from over 80 listings and contains over 3000 review texts with corresponding star ratings.

The analysis combines text processing, sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and text classification to examine linguistic and thematic differences between 5-star and non-5-star reviews. Instead of focusing on ratings alone, the project analyzes review language to understand how emotional tone, recurring themes, and specific operational issues relate to rating outcomes.

By integrating these methods, the results provide structured insights into what characterizes a perfect stay versus a nearly perfect one. For hosts, the findings highlight recurring service gaps that may prevent a listing from consistently receiving 5-star ratings. For guests, the analysis suggests how review content can reveal meaningful differences in experience that may not be fully captured by star ratings alone.

```{python}
#| eval: false
raw_df = pd.DataFrame(all_text_rows)
raw_df.to_csv("~/Desktop/Unstructured Data Analytics/final_project/airbnb_reviews_raw.csv", index=False)
```

```{python}
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('~/Desktop/Unstructured Data Analytics/final_project/airbnb_reviews_raw.csv')
```

df["raw_text"] = df["raw_text"].astype(str)

# Extract star rating from the raw block
df["stars"] = df["raw_text"].str.extract(r"Rating,\s*([1-5])\s*stars?", expand=False)
df["stars"] = pd.to_numeric(df["stars"], errors="coerce")
```

```{python}
# Extract guest review text
text = df["raw_text"].str.split("Stayed", n=1).str[-1] # keep everything after the first "Stayed"
text = text.str.split("\n", n=1).str[-1] # remove the the first line after "Stayed"
text = text.str.split("Response from", n=1).str[0] # remove host response if it exists

# final whitespace cleanup
df["review_text"] = (text.fillna("").str.replace(r"\s+", " ", regex=True).str.strip())
```

```{python}
clean = df[["review_text", "stars"]].copy()

clean = clean[clean["review_text"] != ""]
clean = clean.dropna(subset=["stars"])
clean = clean.drop_duplicates().reset_index(drop=True)
```

```{python}
print("Clean rows:", len(clean))
print(clean["stars"].value_counts().sort_index())
```

```{python}
#| eval: false
clean.to_csv("airbnb_reviews_clean.csv", index=False)
clean.head()
```

## Text Processing

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import re

review = pd.read_csv('~/Desktop/Unstructured Data Analytics/final_project/airbnb_reviews_clean.csv')
```

### Writing style differences between 5-star and non-5-star reviews

```{python}
# Create group variable
review['group'] = review['stars'].apply(lambda x: '5-star' if x == 5 else '1-4-star')
```

```{python}
review['review_text'] = review['review_text'].astype(str)

# Count total words
word_pat = re.compile(r"[A-Za-z']+")
review['word_count'] = review['review_text'].str.findall(word_pat).apply(len)

# Count sentences
review['sentence_count'] = review['review_text'].apply(lambda x: len([s for s in re.split(r'[.!?]+', x) if s.strip()]))

# Count exclamation marks
review['exclam_count'] = review['review_text'].apply(lambda x: x.count('!'))
```

```{python}
# Compare writing style across groups
style_summary = review.groupby('group').agg(
    n=('review_text', 'count'),
    avg_word_count=('word_count', 'mean'),
    avg_sentence_count=('sentence_count', 'mean'),
    avg_exclam_count=('exclam_count', 'mean')
).round(2)

style_summary
```

Non-5-star reviews are longer on average (more words and more sentences). 5-star reviews are shorter but more expressive, using more exclamation marks. This suggests that high ratings often come with enthusiastic, emotional language, while lower ratings contain more detailed descriptions.

### Prepare clean text for modeling

```{python}
import spacy
nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_lg') 

review['review_clean_base'] = (review['review_text'].str.lower().str.replace('[0-9]+', '', regex=True))

docs = list(nlp.pipe(review['review_clean_base']))

# Lemmatize and remove stopwords, punctuation, spaces
review['tokens_lemma'] = [
    [token.lemma_ for token in doc
     if not token.is_stop and not token.is_space and not token.is_punct]
    for doc in docs
]

review['clean_text'] = review['tokens_lemma'].apply(lambda x: ' '.join(x))

review[['review_text', 'clean_text']].head()
```

```{python}
# Remove reviews that are too short
review['token_count'] = review['tokens_lemma'].apply(len)
review = review[review['token_count'] >= 5]
```

## Sentiment Analysis

```{python}
from textblob import TextBlob

review['blob'] = review['review_text'].apply(lambda x: TextBlob(str(x)))

review['tb_polarity'] = review['blob'].apply(lambda x: x.sentiment.polarity)

review['tb_subjectivity'] = review['blob'].apply(lambda x: x.sentiment.subjectivity)
```

```{python}
sentiment_summary = review.groupby('group').agg(
    avg_polarity=('tb_polarity', 'mean'),
    avg_subjectivity=('tb_subjectivity', 'mean')
).round(2)

sentiment_summary
```

```{python}
review['is_negative'] = review['tb_polarity'].apply(lambda x: 1 if x < 0 else 0)

negative_rate = review.groupby('group')['is_negative'].mean().round(3)

negative_rate
```

Sentiment analysis reveals a clear emotional difference between 5-star and non-5-star reviews. 

On average, 5-star reviews have a much higher polarity score (0.41 vs. 0.22), indicating more positive emotional language. They are also slightly more subjective, suggesting that guests express stronger personal feelings in perfect ratings. 

In contrast, non-5-star reviews are more likely to contain negative sentiment. While almost none of the 5-star reviews are negative (0.5%), nearly 10% of non-5-star reviews fall below zero polarity. However, this difference is not absolute, some 4-star reviews still contain highly positive language, suggesting that ratings are influenced by more than just emotional tone.

## Topic Modeling

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import lda
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
```

```{python}
review['clean_text'] = review['clean_text'].astype('str')
review_5 = review[review['group'] == '5-star'].copy()
review_low = review[review['group'] == '1-4-star'].copy()
```

### Top words for 5-star topics

```{python}
vectorizer_5 = CountVectorizer()
X_5 = vectorizer_5.fit_transform(review_5['clean_text'])
vocab_5 = vectorizer_5.get_feature_names_out()

model_5 = lda.LDA(n_topics=3, n_iter=500, random_state=1)
model_5.fit(X_5)
```

```{python}
topic_word_5 = model_5.topic_word_
n_top_words = 10

for i, topic_dist in enumerate(topic_word_5):
    topic_words = np.array(vocab_5)[np.argsort(topic_dist)][:-n_top_words:-1]
    print('Topic {}: {}'.format(i, ' '.join(topic_words)))
```

Topic 0: Positive Stay Experience and Convenient Location

This topic includes words such as “stay”, “place”, “great”, “clean”, “host”, and “recommend”, which reflect overall satisfaction with the accommodation. It also contains “location”, “easy”, and “bus”, suggesting convenience and accessibility. This theme reflects guests who emphasize a smooth and enjoyable stay.

Topic 1: Clean Rooms and Professional Service

This topic includes words such as “room”, “location”, “hotel”, “clean”, “staff”, “check”, and “time”. These words relate to room quality, service interactions, and check-in experiences. This theme reflects guests who evaluate comfort and operational aspects in a positive way.

Topic 2: Comfort, Hospitality, and Feeling at Home

This topic includes words such as “host”, “home”, “comfortable”, “recommend”, and “feel”. These words emphasize emotional comfort and personal hospitality. This theme reflects guests who describe their stay as welcoming and home-like.

### Top words for non-5-star topics

```{python}
vectorizer_low = CountVectorizer()
X_low = vectorizer_low.fit_transform(review_low['clean_text'])
vocab_low = vectorizer_low.get_feature_names_out()

model_low = lda.LDA(n_topics=3, n_iter=500, random_state=1)
model_low.fit(X_low)
```

```{python}
topic_word_low = model_low.topic_word_
n_top_words = 10

for i, topic_dist in enumerate(topic_word_low):
    topic_words = np.array(vocab_low)[np.argsort(topic_dist)][:-n_top_words:-1]
    print('Topic {}: {}'.format(i, ' '.join(topic_words)))
```

Topic 0: General Stay and Location Mentions

This topic includes words such as “location”, “stay”, “room”, “clean”, and “hotel”. These are common descriptive terms that appear in both high and low ratings. They are presented with less emotional intensity compared to 5-star reviews.

Topic 1: Check-In and Guest Experience Issues

This topic includes words such as “host”, “check”, “night”, and “guest”. These words suggest communication, coordination, and service-related interactions. The presence of these terms indicates potential friction during the stay process.

Topic 2: Bathroom, Water, and Room Problems

This topic includes words such as “shower”, “water”, “bathroom”, “issue”, “small”, and “work”. These words point to functional and operational problems. This theme reflects concrete complaints about physical conditions of the accommodation.

### Thematic comparison between 5-star and non-5-star reviews

Topic modeling reveals a clear thematic contrast between 5-star and non-5-star reviews.

The 5-star topics consistently emphasize overall satisfaction, hospitality, comfort, and convenience. Words such as “great,” “recommend,” “comfortable,” and “host” highlight emotional approval and positive experiences. Even when discussing operational aspects like rooms or check-in, the tone remains affirming.

In contrast, non-5-star reviews shift toward specific functional details. Words such as “shower,” “water,” “bathroom,” “issue,” and “small” indicate concrete operational problems. Rather than describing the overall experience, these reviews focus on breakdowns in service or physical conditions.

While both groups mention common features like “room” and “location,” the difference lies in emphasis. 5-star reviews frame these elements positively as part of a satisfying stay, whereas non-5-star reviews highlight them in the context of limitations or issues.

## Text Classification

The review text is converted into TF-IDF features to represent each review numerically. Logistic regression is then applied as a binary classification model, allowing interpretation of how specific words increase or decrease the probability of a 5-star rating.

```{python}
# Create binary target: 1 = 5-star, 0 = non-5-star
review['y_5star'] = review['stars'].apply(lambda x: 1 if x == 5 else 0)

review['y_5star'].value_counts()
```

```{python}
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X = review['clean_text'].astype('str')
y = review['y_5star']

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=1, stratify=y
)
```

```{python}
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

# Convert text into TF-IDF matrix
tfidf_vec = TfidfVectorizer()

X_train_tfidf = tfidf_vec.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_tfidf = tfidf_vec.transform(X_test)

tfidf_tokens = tfidf_vec.get_feature_names_out()
```

```{python}
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report

# Train logistic regression classifier
clf = LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000, random_state=1)
clf.fit(X_train_tfidf, y_train)

# Predictions
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test_tfidf)

# Basic metrics
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"\nAccuracy Score: {accuracy:.4f}")
print(f"Accuracy Percentage: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%")

print("\nDetailed Classification Report:")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```

```{python}
# Get model coefficients for each TF-IDF token
coef = clf.coef_[0]

coef_df = pd.DataFrame({
    'word': tfidf_tokens,
    'coef': coef
}).sort_values('coef', ascending=False)
```

```{python}
# Top words predicting 5-star
top_pos = coef_df.head(15)
top_pos
```

```{python}
# Top words predicting non-5-star
top_neg = coef_df.tail(15).sort_values('coef', ascending=True)
top_neg
```

### Model interpretation

This model was not built simply to predict ratings, since guests already provide star scores. Instead, it helps quantify which specific words and issues are most strongly associated with a drop from 5 stars to lower ratings.

The model achieved a test accuracy of 0.8695, showing that review text alone can strongly distinguish between 5-star and non-5-star reviews. It performs especially well in identifying 5-star reviews, with a recall of 0.990, suggesting that enthusiastic reviews share consistent linguistic patterns. In contrast, lower-rated reviews are more varied in language and therefore harder to classify.

The words with the strongest positive coefficients, such as great, definitely, recommend, perfect, comfortable, amazing, and thank, reflect emotional intensity and strong endorsement. These reviews emphasize satisfaction and appreciation. In comparison, the words most associated with non-5-star reviews, including smell, small, elevator, dirty, expensive, floor, and reservation, focus on concrete operational issues. Many lower-rated reviews do not sound extremely negative, but instead point to specific friction points or unmet expectations.

### Implications for hosts and guests

For hosts, the results suggest that ratings are not reduced because of location or general experience, since those themes appear across both groups. Ratings tend to drop when guests encounter tangible problems such as odors, limited space, noise, or maintenance issues. If hosts want to convert 4-star reviews into 5-star reviews, the most effective strategy is not to highlight positive features more strongly, but to eliminate recurring operational pain points that weaken an otherwise good stay.

For guests, the results suggest that looking at review content in addition to star ratings may provide a more complete picture of a listing. A 4-star review that highlights a great location and comfortable stay may still be a good choice for many travelers, depending on their priorities. By paying attention to recurring themes in the text, such as space, noise, or bathroom conditions, guests can decide whether those issues matter to them personally rather than relying only on the overall rating.
